"You know, I want you to see me laughing, having a good time partying, cracking a joke, doing a movie television show. I didn't want you to see me with tubes running out of me and trying to figure out if I was going to make it through."</p><p>"And to be honest with you, my sister Deidra Dixon, my daughter, Corrine Marie, saved my life," Foxx added. "To them, to God, to a lot of great medical people, I'm able to leave you this video."</p><p>The Beat Shazaam host went on to thank his family for keeping the details of his mystery illness private.</p><p>"I cannot tell you how great it feels to have your family kick in in such a way," Foxx said. "And, y'all know, they kept it airtight. They didn't let nothing out. They protected me."</p><p>Waiting for your permission to load the Instagram Media.</p><p>The Oscar winner noted that since he and his family have remained "quiet" about his condition, people made assumptions, with Foxx jokingly referencing the rumors that he was blind, paralyzed or a clone.</p><p>"I did go through, I went to hell and back, and my road to recovery had some potholes as well," he said. "But I'm coming back and I'm able to work. So I want to thank the people that let me work, and I just wanna say that I love everybody and I love all of the love that I got."</p><p>He then became emotional, beginning to tear up as he shared that his journey has been "tough."</p><p>"I know they talk about people crying on videos. You know, you could do take two, but I'm not gonna do a take two," Foxx explained. "This, it is what it is. And if you see me out from now on, and every once in a while, I just burst into tears. It's because it's been tough, man. I was sick, man, but now I got my legs out under me, so you gonna see me out."</p><p>He concluded his post by again reiterating that he wants fans to remember him for his work, before then signed off.</p><p>"I'm here on Earth 'cause of God, man," Foxx said. "So I love all y'all. I just wanted to jump on here and let you know that I'm on my way back in love."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:62c78e0a-2827-4ab7-b3a6-f4f0a837dbaa data-container-ref=toofab:article:2a8a8f19-d100-46df-b417-a0c9f60df8f0 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/38/5by4/2023/05/12/383922988a574452b6f00013893d0a36_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Kelly Osbourne Praises Jamie Foxx After Stepping In for His Daughter Corinne on 'Beat Shazam'</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3R7j3Bmamlfn66utcRmnaiwqGKyt7HRsmSsoZedwaq6xmaqoqaTmnqpu9KpoK2ZnJ7HosDIqKVo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
