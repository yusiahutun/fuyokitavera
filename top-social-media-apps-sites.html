If you dig past the junk, you can find stunning photography, incredible artwork, and plenty more.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><h2 id=twitter>3. <a href=#>Twitter</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/twitter.png><p>Twitter is another network that's received a considerable amount of negative coverage. The 280-character limit (formerly 140 characters) doesn't exactly promote reasoned debate, and the presence of millions of fake bots only serves to erode the experience further.</p><p>However, if you want breaking news, instant reactions, and access to your favorite sports stars, celebrities, and journalists, Twitter is an unrivaled resource. You can even <a href=#>save videos from Twitter</a> (if you find some good ones!).</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><h2 id=linkedin>4. <a href=#>LinkedIn</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/linkedin-670x438.png><p>LinkedIn provides social networking for professionals. As the site has grown, it's become one of <a href=#>the best ways to build your CV</a>, find a new job, and network within your professional circles.</p><h2 id=snapchat>5. <a href=#>Snapchat</a></h2><p>Snapchat is almost exclusively a young person's hangout; you're unlikely to find your grandma with an account. The site revolves around sharing self-destructing images and videos, though there's also a messaging tool and lots of gamification features.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>Make sure you learn <a href=#>how to make a Snapchat filter</a> if you're new to the app.</p><h2 id=tumblr>6. <a href=#>Tumblr</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/tumblr.png><p>Tumblr is what happens when the worlds of social networking and blogging collide. You can post text, photos, videos, and other media content onto your blog page, which other users can then follow.</p><p>The network also supports HTML editing; if you're skilled enough, you can completely customize the look and layout of your page. You can even use a custom domain name.</p><p>Tumblr is now (supposedly) safe for minors. Prior to an outright ban in December 2018, estimates suggest up to 22% of the site's traffic was pornographic in nature.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><h2 id=pinterest>7. <a href=#>Pinterest</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/pinterest-670x336.png><p>Pinterest is another of the best social media apps. It is best described as an image bookmarking site (though it also supports GIFs and videos). You can add images to your public or private boards, follow other users and boards, and comment on pins.</p><p>The site is excellent if you're looking for inspiration for a DIY project or you need something to spark a creative idea in your head.</p><h2 id=sina-weibo>8. <a href=#>Sina Weibo</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/weibo-670x409.png><p>Sina Weibo is China's answer to Twitter. With more than 500 million users, it is one of the most popular social networks in the world.</p><p>The Chinese government heavily censors the site, but if you want to keep your finger on the pulse of what's happening in Asia, it is worth signing up.</p><h2 id=reddit>9. <a href=#>Reddit</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/reddit-1.png><p>Billed as the front page of the internet, Reddit is part discussion forum, part content submission site. Users can upvote and downvote posts to help influence what is popular at any given moment.</p><p>The site is divided into subreddits. They cover almost every subject matter you can think of. If you have a niche hobby, Reddit is a great place to find like-minded people.</p><p>For a good insight into Reddit, check out our list of <a href=#>fascinating subreddits guaranteed to blow your mind</a>.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><h2 id=tiktok>10. <a href=#>TikTok</a></h2><p>Compared to oldies like Twitter and Facebook, TikTok is a fresh-faced social media apps. It was created to fill the space that Vine left behind after its shutdown, but it's long superseded it.</p><p>There's clearly significant demand for short-form video; TikTok was the world's most downloaded app in the first half of 2018 and has been on an unrelenting rise ever since. Here's <a href=#>everything you need to know about TikTok</a> and <a href=#>the TikTok security risks to be aware of</a>.</p><h2 id=ask-fm>11. <a href=#>Ask.fm</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/askfm-670x489.png><p>The next entry on our list of social media apps is Ask.fm. It's a question-and-answer site where users submit queries. Anyone can jump in and offer their thoughts.</p><p>The site used to be anonymous, but the suicides of two British teenagers after they were allegedly cyberbullied forced a much-needed rethink. Today, Ask.fm is one of the <a href=#>sites that parents should add to their block list</a>.</p><h2 id=vkontakte>12. <a href=#>VKontakte</a></h2><p>VKontakte is the Russian equivalent of Facebook; it is the most popular site in the country.</p><p>The network shares many of the same features as its American counterpart, including groups, pages, private messaging, event management, image tagging, and in-app games.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><h2 id=flickr>13. <a href=#>Flickr</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/flickr.png><p>Flickr is primarily a photo-hosting site. There are free and paid options. The free option used to provide 1TB of space, but at the start of 2019, the company reduced it to 1,000 images.</p><p>Users can comment, share, and like the photos that they appreciate.</p><h2 id=meetup>14. <a href=#>Meetup</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/meetup-com.png><p>Meetup straddles the divide between an online social network and a real-life social network. You can use the online tools to find groups and events that match your interests, then turn up to the group's next meetup.</p><p>If you live in a big city, the available meetups can be as diverse as sports teams to language learning groups. In more rural areas, the choices can be more limited.</p><h2 id=internations>15. <a href=#>InterNations</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/internations.png><p>If you're an expat, you should have an account on InterNations.

It has strict privacy controls, meaning only people who live in your area can join your neighborhood's specific group.</p><p>If you're looking for a way to manage neighborhood watch schemes, organize local bring-and-buys, or just keep everyone abreast of the local community's news, <a href=#>you need Nextdoor in your life</a>.</p><h2 id=tinder>18. <a href=#>Tinder</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/tinder-photo-verification-670x335.jpg><p>Are you looking for love?

There is also a stream of news and opinion articles about the wider industry.</p><h2 id=even-more-social-networks-to-explore>Even More Social Networks to Explore</h2><p>There are thousands of social media apps in the world.
