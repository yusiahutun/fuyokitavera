The depiction of teen Harry in The Crown also shows how the two brothers coped with their mother’s unfortunate demise.</strong></p><p>Before The Crown’s final run, <a href=#>Prince Harry</a> released his explosive memoir Spare, which became the fastest-selling non-fiction book ever. In it, Harry opened up about his shock when he received the news of his mother’s death and the aftermath where ‘nothing was okay’ for a long time.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/12/GettyImages-76081926-835x1024.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-prince-harry-is-portrayed-as-the-jealous-teen-in-netflix-s-the-crown>Prince Harry is portrayed as the ‘jealous teen’ in Netflix’s The Crown</h2><p>Harry has been candid about his difficult relationship with his brother <a href=#>William</a>, whom he addresses as an ‘arch-nemesis and beloved brother’ in his book. The teen version of Harry in The Crown seems upset by his brother’s growing popularity among women and resorts to drinking to cope with his grief.</p><p>In one particular scene, Harry pours a drink for his brother and says: “Well, this is a riot!” He quickly adds: “I filled it with champagne. Come on, you know you want to.” At another event, Harry raises a toast to his mother with William, saying ‘to mummy.’</p><p>Prince Harry has opened up about his struggles with alcohol and anger issues after his mother <a href=#>Princess Diana</a>‘s sudden death. In the Anderson Cooper show earlier this year, he revealed: “It was obvious to us as kids the British press’s part in our mother’s misery and I had a lot of anger inside of me that, luckily, I never expressed to anybody.</p><p>“But I resorted to drinking heavily. Because I wanted to numb the feeling, or I wanted to distract myself from how… whatever I was thinking. And I would, you know, resort to drugs as well.”</p><p>Harry also accepts his relationship with his brother had its difficult phases. In an interview with Good Morning America, he confessed: “There has always been this competition between us, weirdly. I think it plays into this heir-spare.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/12/GettyImages-76435208-1024x726.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-harry-and-meghan-could-not-escape-the-shadow-of-the-royal-family>Harry and Meghan could not ‘escape’ the shadow of the royal family</h2><p>After a tumultuous 2023, Harry and Meghan’s recent weeks could be bittersweet. On one hand, Harry has won his case against a British Publication that gathered information unlawfully to publish in articles. Harry’s historic victory is a sign that he is on a mission, say <a href=#>royal</a> experts.</p><p>On the other end, the latest season of The Crown did not help with Harry’s image. A source close to the royals reportedly <a href=# rel=nofollow>offered</a>: “They went into [2023] with such high hopes, thinking they had finally proven themselves in Hollywood and escaped the shadow of the royal family. But these scandals just blew up out of nowhere, tearing their image to shreds.”</p><p>“As much as Meghan wants it all to be water off a duck’s back, these incidents have cut deep. To say it’s been a year she’d prefer to forget is a serious understatement – she can’t believe 2023 is ending like this.”</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmpqX2eGcMDVZqqhp6disaa8yJyrrGWgp7avr8Rmn5qqoq56or%2BMsJ%2BipqliwaaxzZqenqpdn7KiuM6uqmanlmLEqrjLopimZw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
