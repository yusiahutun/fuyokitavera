It was being fumigated! And somehow, through the magic of Christmas, he went in and redid my whole room,” Michael <a href=#>shared</a>.</p><a id=gallery-link-b4a7c4e2-4498-5027-ac2b-5381d5d72085 class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:b4a7c4e2-4498-5027-ac2b-5381d5d72085 data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:29ce81c4-f2a5-4771-8840-88ff7f3d555b data-gallery-layout=list><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/6c/4by3/2019/12/19/6c97aafea2d654cbb3eb35a2d33a2956_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class="media-credit gallery-block__media-credit">Everett Collection/Getty</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3N7kGtma2xfqMGivtJmnZqun6e2tbGMppymp6KesrR5x6ijopyRrnq0scCspqdn</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
