Chou asked people to be careful and said that NFT theft is not a joke by adding hashtags to the post.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Chou’s stolen NFT is from Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC), one of the world’s most valuable NFT collections.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">On Friday the collection’s cheapest NFT on sale cost 108 ether, roughly equivalent to US$352,695. The NFT allegedly stolen from Chou was sold on the LooksRare platform for 130 ether, roughly US$424,541.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">On OpenSea, the world’s largest NFT marketplace, the account that appears to be operated by Jay Chou was marked on Friday as compromised.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">On Etherscan, an Ethereum analytics platform, the crypto wallet address that Chou’s allegedly stolen NFT was transferred to is marked with a warning, which says that it was reported to have been used in a phishing scam, and that users should exercise caution when interacting with the address.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">China’s industrial agency plans NFTs but companies remain cautious</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The rapidly-evolving NFT space has become riddled with global scams, fraud and theft recently, with little regulatory oversight in place.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Money sent to NFT marketplaces by illicit addresses jumped significantly in the third quarter of 2021, reaching US$1 million worth of cryptocurrency, and the value further grew in the fourth quarter to just under US$1.4 million, according to a report published in February by research firm Chainalysis.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Among recent cases, in February, 17 OpenSea users had their NFTs stolen in a targeted phishing attack, and stolen assets were estimated to be worth US$1.7 million.</p><img data-qa=BaseImage-handleRenderImage-StyledImage src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/wide_landscape/public/d8/video/thumbnail/2021/04/09/nft_thumbnail_web_plain_vertical_1.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewDuration class="css-dkee4u eaw92su1">05:15</p><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewTitle class="css-1ajvbe4 eaw92su2">SCMP Explains: What are NFTs?</p><p>SCMP Explains: What are NFTs?</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">On Friday, BAYC also said on Twitter that its channel on Discord, a group messaging app popular in the NFT space, “was briefly compromised”, but that they “caught it immediately”, without elaborating further. It is not clear if Chou’s stolen NFT was related to the BAYC incident.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Chou is among several Asian celebrities who have been promoting NFTs since last year, including Hong Kong actors Edison Chen and Shawn Yue Man-lok, and Singaporean singer JJ Lin. Projects endorsed and launched by them have drawn huge attention in the region.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In January, an NFT collection named PhantomBear, launched by the Jay Chou-backed fashion brand PHANTACi, briefly topped OpenSea’s 24-hour sales volume chart.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kwaavx2irnpuYYsGzsc2dqmiZoqm2pLjEaGpqb2JshnF705qgsJmemsCmedKtmKtlmpbGbq%2FHqKxmq5GuwG6uzqucnWWRpbJuusWtZKGZo2KvprHNZqqtp5yauw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
