It’s really gone through the roof.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Born in Israel, Hiaeve, 36, grew up in Queens, New York. At 16 years old, he opened Avi & Co, an exclusive high-end retailer that now caters to some of the notable names in the world: Foxx, Nicki Minaj and Justin Bieber, to name only a few.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">His family has always been in the jewellery business, he said, but the watch industry is where he truly found his calling.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Jewellery was something my family was doing, so it was easier to learn it. But watches, this is something that came from a hobby,” Hiaeve said.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Luxury online resale market soars as wealthy buyers go on spending spree</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I used to love watches and play around with them. And you know what? I just felt like they were good investments. After a while, it became my main business.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Most of Hiaeve’s clients come from word of mouth: basketball players, rappers and football players flock to him because they’re referred by existing customers.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In addition to the hype around owning a Rolex or Richard Mille, he said, most understand that many luxury watches hold good investment value, like a Birkin bag or Basquiat painting. These high-end, quality goods have historically proved to retain the value paid for them or even become more valuable over time, often significantly.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“A lot of people turn from a hobby to a business in the watch game,” Hiaeve said. “A lot of collectors that I know that used to buy from me, after a while they started buying for investments – buying, selling and trading.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2021/05/12/7a1e394a-aed9-11eb-9c9f-63ba12e765d1_972x_022139.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Though consultancy Bain reported in November 2020 that the luxury goods market had fallen 23 per cent to US$265 billion from 2019, very expensive items such as Hermès bags have long had a timeless quality, relatively untouched by financial discord and market downturns.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">And people love Hermès as much as they ever have: when the brand reopened some stores in April last year after months of widespread closures, it brought in a whopping US$2.7 million in just one day at one of its stores in China alone.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Hiaeve said Richard Mille is the Hermès of watches. On the resale market, the brand’s watches consistently go up in value. Hiaeve said he’s seen some go from US$100,000 to US$120,000 in just a few months. Celebrity watch collectors clearly agree: Drake has one that costs at least US$750,000.</p><figure data-qa=Component-StyledFigure class="css-1yuz473 exv1azg4">Product innovation and the ability to establish and nurture product icons is vital – Rolex has done a fantastic job on this frontBernstein analyst Luca Solca</figure>The next best investment after Richard Mille, Hiaeve said, is a <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Rolex</span></a>. That’s not just because they are beautiful, he said, but because they also retain their value. Next is Audemars Piguet – Bieber bought one in 2019 for US$50,000 as a “li’l wedding gift” to himself. Patek Philippe is also a solid choice – Jay-Z owns one worth at least US$2.2 million.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“[Richard Mille is] the most expensive,” Hiaeve says, before revealing that he once sold one for almost US$3 million. “It‘s not just the craftsmanship, it’s the supply and demand. They only make maybe four or five thousand watches a year. So you can’t really get them.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Adam Golden, the owner of Menta Watches, told GQ last year that while his overall watch sales had declined, the pandemic brought new opportunities his way – like a German client who wanted to “park some money” in a US$300,000 portfolio of watches instead of in the stock market and requested Golden’s help putting that portfolio of “stable watches” together.</p>Before the coronavirus pandemic hit and destabilised global financial markets, the luxury sector was still recovering from the impact of the <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">2019 Hong Kong protests</span></a>, which saw Swiss watch imports to Hong Kong decline by 26.8 per cent in comparison to 2018. Facing the coronavirus pandemic, the luxury watch industry was preparing for its worst year yet.<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2021/05/12/2fc0034c-aed9-11eb-9c9f-63ba12e765d1_972x_022139.jpeg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In March 2020, Rolex shut down all of its Swiss factories, while Richemont, the luxury conglomerate that owns Cartier, had discounted second-hand pieces on its vintage resale site, Bloomberg reported at the time. Watch fairs throughout the world were called off, while smaller and newer brands braced for impact to their bottom lines.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">That was then. Now, a so-called “K-shaped” recovery is taking hold as only the best-placed brands come out of the economic crunch largely unscathed, according to a February report by Bernstein, while others fare worse.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The Swatch Group, for example, owner of high-end brands including Blancpain, Breguet, Harry Winston and Omega, as well as fashion watches including Swatch and Calvin Klein, was slammed by the Covid-19 pandemic and the subsequent economic nosedive.</p>Meanwhile, brands with cachet such as Rolex were little affected. “Product innovation and the ability to establish and nurture product icons is vital – Rolex has done a fantastic job on this front,” <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Bernstein’s analyst Luca Solca said</span></a> following the release of the February report.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It goes back to the mantra mentioned before: pandemic or not, those who want to buy a Rolex, or an US$800,000 Patek Philippe, a US$2.2 million Richard Mille or a Salmon Dial Audemars Piguet Royal Oak for US$441,000, will always find a way to get one.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuaqyxKyrsqSVZLOiv8eipqdlkpqutsDYaJirrJmYuaZ7kmpqbGhgZXyjsdKtZKWtqKq%2FunnWmqucoJWoeqq61Z6qrWWRo7Fuw8eoZKOZnZ6ybrLOsa9moqWowaq6</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
