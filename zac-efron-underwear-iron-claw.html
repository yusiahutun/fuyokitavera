I've never experienced that one before," he added. "You just kind of gottaâ€¦ like, where do you put your hands? On your hips? You can't help -- there are people everywhere, you can't look up and have somebody not looking back at you!

You're sore a lot. It's called delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS), and they get pretty debilitating. It's hard to move around and you just feel old," Efron explained. "But other than that, there's so much adrenaline. I think when you're in the ring wrestling, you kind of become invincible."</p><p>He continued, "I don't know what I could relate it to other than skateboarding when I was a kid -- but you can do incredible things and the pain is dissociated from your mind, until you get home later that night, and you're like, 'F--k man, what did I do?' and your ribs are broken or something.'"</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:31d48813-da5f-4694-a64a-391f9968bf23 data-container-ref=toofab:article:9cfc059e-a558-416e-a8b6-716e84ce80c1 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/4a/5by4/2023/12/11/4a59b3fedbb546d5bab23b6ce005e4c3_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Zac Efron Emotionally Remembers Matthew Perry During Hollywood Walk of Fame Ceremony</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>In the end, the training paid off, with Efron, who starred in the film alongside <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" title=https://toofab.com/tags/jeremyallenwhite/><strong>Jeremy Allen White</strong></a> and Harris Dickinson, sharing that all those grueling hours in the gym went into the way he developed his character.</p><p>"There was so much of the way that you feel, the way that you walk, the way it changes your demeanor -- all of that goes into the character in one way or another, so it all became one kind of process," Efron shared before thanking the stunt team and those in the ring that helped make the wrestling scenes as real as possible.</p><p>"I can't give a big enough shout-out to the guys we worked with out there. We had an incredible stunt team, and the guys in the ring really took care of us. I think they recognized that we had an enthusiasm and a passion to make this as real as possible and that just fueled them to take extra care of us and teach us little nuances and point out things," he added.
