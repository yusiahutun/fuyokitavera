I think he’s shown the Edwards that he’s found his voice. He can think for himself," &nbsp;Taylor said of the boy’s growing independence.</p><p>Of course, there were other points in which Taylor became downright defensive.</p><p>And how could anyone blame him when you’re dealing with this crew of losers?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>“Ya’ll saw the clip. He sat there and called my wife a B—h. In past seasons the things he’s done to Bentley, poking fun at him, making fun of him, calling him a cry baby," Taylor railed after a montage of Ryan’s worst moments from the past season was shown.</p><p>"Enough is enough. Grow up and be a man. Don’t be a coward. Come sit out here and sit on the couch with us.”</p><p>Asked if he believes that Ryan is sober, as he claims to be, Taylor did’t mince any words:</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>‘“No I don’t. This is our opinion," he told host Dr. Drew.</p><p>"It’s based on when he shows up to something or when you see him sitting there in a scene and he can’t hardly keep his eyes open," Taylor continued.</p><p>‘That’s not a place I feel safe to send our son with that guy.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>If you look at that last statement closely enough, you’ll find the moment that’s causing fans to lose their minds over appreciation for Taylor.</p><p>Yes, Taylor referred to Bentley not as his stepson, but instead as "our son."</p><p>"I have a new love and appreciation for Taylor standing up for Bentley and calling him ‘our son,’" one person wrote on Twitter.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>"Listen, Taylor did not come to play with you hoes! I knew he was a real one but when he said ‘OUR SON’ I was giving that man a standing ovation!" another added. "THAT’S A MAN."</p><p>Amazingly, Maci "liked" both of those tweets, which is basically her way of saying Bentley is indeed Ryan’s son.</p><p>Yes, Maci is no doubt basking in victory after dominating the reunion show and getting the entire<a href=#> Edwards family fired </a>afterward.</p><p>But at the end of the day, she still has a son with Ryan — which means she’ll still have to deal with him on occasion.</p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2tpX2WCcLnAnKBmmp%2BkuLDB02aqnKqVrHqzxcCnZJ6cp5a%2Fpb%2BMm5ynrJyaxm610marmrGcpL9uucKkoKemla7Abr%2FOp2Y%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
