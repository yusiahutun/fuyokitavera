While hosting one of the many awards of the night, The Last of Us star Bella Ramsey and Hamilton alumni Anthony Ramos read a quip about the celebrities in the category. It’s safe to say Ariana didn’t take too kindly to it – though <a href=#>this isn’t the first joke</a> this award season to not land well.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/01/GettyImages-1239557686-1024x819.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-ariana-debose-blasts-critics-choice-awards-joke>Ariana DeBose blasts Critics Choice Awards joke</h2><p>Taking to her <a href=#>Instagram</a> Story, the actress clarified how she felt about a joke told by Bella and Anthony as they presented the award for Best Song. In the scripted moment, they took aim at <a href=#>movie</a> stars Ariana, Jack Black, and Ryan Gosling for being “actors who also think that they are singers.”</p><p>Ariana wrote simply: “No, I didn’t find it funny. Lol.”</p><p>Elsewhere in their introduction, Bella, 20, had read the category containing artists and <a href=#>Hollywood</a> actors who had “delivered by some of the most famous voices in the music industry.”</p><p>She then named Dua Lipa, Lenny Kravitz, and Billie Eilish – Not Ariana.</p><p><strong>MORE: </strong><a href=#>Golden Globes: Bradley Cooper’s ‘villainous’ face of defeat to Cillian Murphy has Twitter cackling</a></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-it-s-no-surprise-it-didn-t-go-down-well>It’s no surprise it didn’t go down well</h2><p>Ariana has been in many musicals over the years, both in film and on stage, so it’s no surprise the joke didn’t land well. She won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress in 2022 for her role as Anita in Steven Spielberg’s 2021 remake of West Side Story. She also has a Tony Award for Best Featured Actress in a Musical after she portrayed <a href=#>music</a> star Donna Summer in Summer: The Donna Summer Musical. Not only that, but she appeared in the show between 2017 and 2018 both on and off-Broadway</p><p>Ariana DeBose was nominated in the category at the Critics Choice Awards, where the joke was told for her work on Disney’s latest animation feature Wish. She stars as Asha, a 17-year-old girl named Asha who wishes upon a star to save her kingdom Rosas after sensing a dark force coming.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-who-won-best-song-at-the-critics-choice-awards>Who won Best Song at the Critics Choice Awards?</h2><p>Funnily enough, despite their joke which rubbed Ariana Debose the wrong way at the Critics Choice Awards, Ryan Gosling took home the accolade. He was nominated for his performance of the song I’m Just Ken from Greta Gerwig’s Barbie.</p><p>Ryan had perhaps one of the best reactions to winning the gong as he looked very shocked when it was announced. The <a href=#>celebrity</a> was supposed to go on stage to accept the award but remained in the audience. The award was instead accepted by the song’s writers, Mark Ronson and Andrew Wyatt.</p><p>In the speech, Mark said: “Ryan Gosling, this is as much your&nbsp;award as ours. You made the world, or the audience, fall in love with this song with your matchless performance, so thank you”.</p><p>Ryan could then be seen beaming from his seat.</p><p><strong>MORE:</strong> <a href=#>Golden Globes: J Lo says Ben Affleck’s ‘grumpy’ photos aren’t a big deal</a></p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlpX2aCcK3RopinmV2ZsqO70p5knJmcocBuu9StZKOnm5p6osCMnKmirJmYwG6vx6ignJ1dlsSivsOsZJ2hlKPBbrLIp5tmoaRis7a6zbJm</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
