In fact, you can break it down into easy payments of just $32,638 a month.</p><p>The lakeside home ultimately sold for&nbsp;$6,025,000, according to <a href=#>Zillow</a>. That&nbsp;price&nbsp;gives the lucky buyer&nbsp;a 7,687 square-foot single family residence built in 2008, sitting on just over an acre of beautifully landscaped grounds. The house features a stone exterior and metal roof. Amenities include five bedrooms and six full bathrooms, with three half baths. Features include a main floor master suite, lake views from all bedrooms, terrace level family room with a full bar and game area, outdoor full bathroom and a two-car garage.</p><p>There's also a professionally equipped kitchen and outdoor living spaces including a terrace level covered porch, a flagstone patio with a fire pit and a two-story boathouse with dock. The property is in a very exclusive lakeside community and is accessible only via a gate that leads to a beautiful stone driveway.</p><p>The Jacksons have been doing quite a bit of downsizing over the past few years. Two years after they sold their enormous Tennessee home to move to a gated community, they also listed their <a href=#>estate in Florida</a> for $15 million, and they listed <a href=#>another lake house in Smithville, Tenn.</a>, for the more affordable price of $4,995,000.</p><p>The Jacksons also <a href=#>sold their spectacular hilltop estate</a> outside of Nashville for $19 million in March of 2021.</p><p>Scroll through the photos below to see inside Jackson's lakefront Georgia mansion, and keep scrolling to see inside his antebellum mansion and his hilltop estate outside of Nashville.</p><h2 class=photogallery-title>PICTURES: See Inside Alan Jackson's Stunning Lakefront Georgia Mansion</h2><p>Alan Jackson sold his lakefront mansion in Georgia for just over $6 million, and pictures show a stunning property that's as relaxing as it is luxurious.</p><h2 class=photogallery-title>PICTURES: See Inside Alan Jackson's Spectacular Hilltop Estate</h2><p>After selling their spectacular Southern manor home in 2010, Alan Jackson and his wife moved to to what might be an even more impressive mansion, if that's even possible. Their 5-bedroom, 8-bathroom, 22,012-square-foot estate in the same Nashville suburb of Franklin features bedrooms that are all well-appointed suites, while the formal dining and living areas are finished off with splendid arched doorways, oversized windows and elaborate woodwork. The residence also includes a bar, a media room and multiple indoor and outdoor fireplaces. It sold for $19 million in March of 2021.</p><h2 class=photogallery-title>PICTURES: See Inside Alan Jackson's Massive Southern Manor Home</h2><p>Alan Jackson's former 18,622-square-foot plantation-style estate sits on 135 acres in Franklin, Tenn., an affluent rural suburb outside of Nashville. The staggering residence includes formal dining and living rooms, a home office with maple floors, a spacious family room with 22 ft. ceilings, a gourmet kitchen with an adjoining breakfast room and a glass-enclosed porch on the first floor. There are four bedroom suites on the second floor, along with an exercise room and nanny quarters. The third floor has a game room, home theater and a custom pub. The property sold for $28 million in 2010, making it one of the largest sales of a private residence in Nashville.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmmqSRo3qrrcKkqqimXZyysL7GophmpJGgsm60zq6qnmWWpL9uv8ClnGaomZjBtr7ErGY%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
