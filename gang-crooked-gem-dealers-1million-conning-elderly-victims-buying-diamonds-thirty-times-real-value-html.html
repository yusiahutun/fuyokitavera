victims into buying diamonds for up to thirty times their actual worth</p><p><span>A gang of gem dealers made £1million by conning elderly victims into buying diamonds for up to thirty times their actual worth, a court heard today.</span></p><p><span>As part of the alleged boiler room fraud, the gang cold-called investors, many of them pensioners, before sending them glossy brochures for bogus company No1 Gems, based in Hove, East Sussex.</span></p><p><span>Among the victims was </span><span>a retired police officer duped into using up the last of his savings to buy coloured stones for £140,000 which were worth little more than £10,000.</span></p><p><span>Mastermind Adam Simmons, his father Michael, brother-in-law Adam Leach and Lee Miller were jailed in September last year after being convicted of fraud, while alleged </span><span>conspirator John Bishop, 32, denies heading up one of the sales offices for the scam in Marbella, Spain, the Old Bailey was told.</span></p><p><span>Bishop was arrested in October last year after returning to the UK from Spain.</span></p><p><span>Adam Simmons set up No1 Gems, based in Hove, East Sussex, in late 2011 and conned investors for the best part of a year, the court heard.<br></span></p><p><span>By the time the company was raided by police in September 2012, they had closed down their operation and were preparing to start a similar firm called Pinnacle in nearby Eastbourne.</span></p><p><span>'Basically, No1 Gems were engaged in what is known as a boiler room fraud,' said </span><span>David Durose, prosecuting.</span><br></p><h2>RELATED ARTICLES</h2><ul class="rotator-pages link-xocc"><li class=rotator-prev><a href=# data-page=prev>Previous</a></li><li><a href=# data-page=1>1</a></li><li

class=imageCaption>Family: Adam Simmons's father Michael (pictured) was also sentenced in September last year</p><p><span>Retired William Doorbar, from Stoke, Staffordshire, was one of those targeted, the court heard.<br></span></p><p><span>He initially agreed to buy one 0.26 carat green diamond for £5,598 in March 2012 after a No1 Gems representative told him he could make annual returns upwards of 20 per cent.</span></p><p><span>‘It sounds like a good investment,’ said Mr Durose.</span></p><p><span>‘But the 20 per cent is how much the value of the diamond would go up, not how much he paid for it would go up.</span></p><p><span>‘Even if the rate came through, if the diamond was originally purchased for £350, after three years it would still be worth less than £1,000.</span></p><p><span>‘This was not an investment - this was a scam.’</span></p><p><span>Mr Doorbar was told that HSBC had agreed to buy the firm’s entire stock for £15.5million and offered the chance of buying three jewels to make a £38,000 profit in one month.</span></p><p><span>He was also told the Argyle diamond mine in Australia would shortly be closing and this would push up prices.</span></p><p><span>‘He was told it would only be a small amount of time before there was a huge return,’ said Mr Durose.</span></p><p><span>‘They suggested he consider taking out a loan if he could not afford it.’</span></p><p><span>Mr Doorbar bought a total of nine stones from the firm and used the last of his savings for his final £9,000 purchase.</span></p><p><span>No1 Gems agreed to refund him £3,000 when he raised suspicions - but the money never materialised.</span></p><p><span>Bishop, of Felixstowe, Suffolk, denies conspiracy to defraud and fraudulent trading between 31 October 2011 and 10 September 2012 and transferring criminal property.</span></p><p><span>The trial continues.</span></p><p class=postsid
