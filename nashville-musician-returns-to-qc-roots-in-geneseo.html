(102 S. State St.) at 7 p.m. to kick off the <a href=#>55th-annual Geneseo Music Festival</a>, all weekend, mainly at Geneseo City Park.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ourquadcities.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2023/06/Ryan1.png><p>A 48-year-old Moline native, Bizarri moved from Coal Valley to Nashville, Tenn., 20 years ago, and moved back with his wife and daughter, to Geneseo in spring 2022.</p><p>“We got a daughter Taylor, she was a junior coming in here and we wanted her to kind of have some Midwest roots and it’s just really great to be back here,” Bizarri said on Thursday.</p><p>She just graduated Geneseo High School and will attend Black Hawk College in the fall. Taylor also is an accomplished musician, her proud dad said.</p><p>Bizarri really enjoyed his Nashville life, which included co-writing a 2014 hit for Rodney Atkins, <a href=#>“Eat, Sleep, Love You, Repeat.”</a></p><p>“That was a dream come true. Rodney played it at the Opry, WLLR played it; lots of people played it,” Bizarri said. “They made line dances for it. And my phone rang off the hook more after that happened. So it was, it was quite a trip.”</p><p>“Nashville was awesome and Nashville is like a slot machine,” he said. “You can keep pulling that lever and you might lose a few times, but you’re gonna win eventually. I had such a great dose of success and fun and experience that, it made sense to come back here.”</p><p>“I’m excited to kind of get my feet into some of the breweries and still maintain my Nashville business,” Bizarri said. “I’m excited to bring my original songs to the Quad Cities and Geneseo, and share the stories.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ourquadcities.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2023/06/Ryan7.jpg><p>“I just kind of flipped the side of things, just waking up to the Midwest sunrise and occasionally getting back down to Nashville,” he said.</p><p>In 2010, Bizarri recorded his album, “If I Was a Song” in Nashville.</p><p>“It was the coolest experience ever, having the best Nashville musicians play on it and mixing and mastering it with a guy who actually produced Rick Springfield,” he said. “I’m so proud of the songs on that disk. Most of them have all won some kind of award. I did that in like 2010 and then fast forward to 2023. I’m overdue for another one.”</p><p>For six years in Tennessee, Bizarri worked as a Realtor, but he’s not doing that in the QC. “I don’t know if I could handle it. It might be rougher than the music business,” he said.</p><p>He was one of 10 nominees in a Country Music Television nationwide songwriting contest in 2010 — a finalist for the CMT Listeners’ Choice Award for emerging songwriters.</p><p>Since 2003, he said the QC live music scene and craft breweries have exploded.</p><p>“It’s a fun experience. You can go try new things and meet new people and even the musicians I’ve seen around town are just, they’re blowing me away,” Bizarri said.</p><p>The full schedule for Geneseo Music Festival is:</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ourquadcities.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2023/06/Geneseo-fest.png><p><strong><u>Friday, June 16</u></strong></p><ul><li><strong>6 p.m.:</strong> 2023 Geneseo Music Fest begins and Food Trucks open</li><li><strong>6 – 8 p.m.:</strong> Geneseo Rotary Ice Cream Social –&nbsp;Geneseo City Park</li><li><strong>6 p.m.:</strong> Kiwanis Annual Doo Dah Parade –&nbsp;Downtown Geneseo</li><li><strong>6:15 p.m.:</strong> Geneseo Panic!
