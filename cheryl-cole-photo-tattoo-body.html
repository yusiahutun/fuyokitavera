The brunette beauty, who is pictured being piggy backed by a hunky male assistant, seemed to be having&nbsp;a great time&nbsp;as she smiled away and was transported up a sand dune.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/b66b51645711-desert-a.jpg><p id=ejQpha42YU3y data-wc=97>Cheryl looked stunning as usual with her hair billowing in the wind, and looked happy to reveal her rose-patterned back tattoo. The pop singer <a class=hm-link href=#>had the controversial inking done about nine months ago</a>, after braving an excruciating 15-hour process."#BTS on my Calendar shoot! Sandals and Sandhills don't go! #piggyback," wrote Cheryl, alongside the snapshot.The fun photoshoot comes just a week after the news emerged that Cheryl and her former boyfriend <span><strong>Tre Holloway&nbsp;</strong></span>had split. According to The Sun, the couple actually <a class=hm-link href=#>called time on their romance back in June</a>, but have remained good friends since.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/fd6643a8db8a-kiss-me-quick-a.jpg><p id=eSqmiSN60-ma data-wc=128>The pair are thought to have split because of their conflicting work schedules, and the pressure of maintaining a long-distance relationship as Cheryl lived in the UK and Tre remained in Los Angeles. "It was a mutual decision so there's no bad feelings," an insider said. "They want to remain good friends. "Her home is here, her family's here, her dogs are here. She was always going back and forth and you can't have a relationship like that, it just didn't work. "The newly-single Cheryl took to Twitter to thank her fans — who she calls her "Little Soldiers" — for their support. "Sometimes I just sit here by myself wondering why you're all so kind and nice and caring towards me. It's gets overwhelming. #soldiers," she wrote.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfmLKtscGroK2hlah8c3yQbGhpaWNmgnGCkWiaoZ2irrlur86lnGaomKTBsHnTmqutp59ir7Cw2Gg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
