While January might be the time of year when we all dust off our gym clothes and get serious about our health, it can be hard to stay motivated for more than a few weeks. If you're finding your resolve to cut the crips and hit the treadmill waning already, booking into an <a class=hm-link href=#>exercise</a> class might be the way forward.</p><p id=eWhHbvea44R data-wc=154>Here at<strong>&nbsp;HELLO!</strong>, we've been swapping boozy nights at the pub for some of London's most popular workouts that get our blood pumping and our endorphins flowing. According to fitness expert Sarah Spence, you're way more likely to stick to your guns if you book a class, planning your schedule around your workouts and not vice versa. Plus, exercising in a room full of people is the best way to stay motivated, she revealed in a new '<a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Keeping Up Appearances</a>' study. &nbsp;"You've got to build the discipline; set your clothes out, plan your week, set your alarm, book your classes, do your food shop when you’re not hungry, plan your meals, and show up on the days you don’t want to. If that’s still tough; book a class with a friend so you can’t let them down or tell someone your plan for the week and get them to keep you accountable," she says.</p><p id=e_Si8QDLCU6 data-wc=20>From high-intensity interval training (HIIT) to rowing, hot yoga, spinning and Pilates, check out the best fitness classes in London.</p><h2>1REBEL</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/86dedec5ee22-1rebel-ride-studio-victoria.jpg><h3>What is it?</h3><p id=eWerbaFguQv data-wc=86>Pounding music blasting pop and EDM anthems, dimly lit studios and disco lighting, 1REBEL is high energy and high intensity. The studios are very chic and pride themselves on being LGBTQ+ friendly – and the changing rooms have hair straighteners and beauty essentials on-hand if you're heading straight to work or post-spin drinks. Choose between RIDE (cycling), REFORMER (Pilates), RUMBLE (boxing) or RESHAPE, their signature class mixing treadmill sprints and bench work. Classes are 45 minutes long and trust me, they live up to the hype.</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">More Fitspo</h4><ul class=relatedContentListClass_ra09n5z><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="I went for a walk every day - here's what it did to my stress levels" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/88c3459ba480-walking2.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="I went for a walk every day - here's what it did to my stress levels" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>I went for a walk every day - here's what it did to my stress levels</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="I followed Princess Kate's exhausting workout routine for two weeks - and the results are staggering" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/ad12c3ffcb65-kate-middleton-workout-routine.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="I followed Princess Kate's exhausting workout routine for two weeks - and the results are staggering" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>I followed Princess Kate's exhausting workout routine for two weeks - and the results are staggering</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="I’m a personal trainer and here’s how to reset your approach to exercise" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/176bb9d5d203-lavina-fitness.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="I’m a personal trainer and here’s how to reset your approach to exercise" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>I’m a personal trainer and here’s how to reset your approach to exercise</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li></ul><h3>What’s it like?</h3><p id=eLL4XPfpOFP data-wc=109>I’ll confess – I am a 1REBEL addict. I am now the kind of person who turns down evening plans so I can get up at 6am for RIDE. Having started my (fairly recent) spinning journey in 2023, I find 1REBEL the best option in London. The resistance is higher, the music is better and the teachers will push you harder than other classes, but it's also a lot more fun. The playlists and structured format of the sessions are motivational; you're sweating, but you're enjoying yourself. I particularly love the themed sessions which tend to take place on a Friday – *NSYNC v. N-Dubz was a personal highlight.</p><h3>Is it good for beginners?</h3><p id=elfkfsMrjnx data-wc=95>It’s intense, but everyone has to start somewhere. When I first bit the bullet and tried RESHAPE (their hardest class), I nearly fell off my treadmill in shock at how fast everyone was going. But when I emerged, red-faced and panting, the sense of pride I felt was unparalleled. Tell reception that it’s your first time and make sure you’re waiting outside the class for a pre-session induction. 1REBEL also offers special Rebuild Sessions every Monday which are 75% of the intensity of a normal session and a great way to ease in for beginners.</p><h3>How much is it?</h3><p id=egf5osN7dn-5 data-wc=85>I’m not going to lie, it’s expensive. The best deal financially is to book the 12-month fixed contract, which ranges from a two-session pass for £38 per month all the way up to £179 per month for the top level of commitment. 1REBEL does a special introductory deal of 3 Sessions for £49 so you can see if you like it first. I book via the Classpass app which costs £70 a month and works out as one session a week with credits left over.</p><p id=eDZ6eE_Bre data-wc=3><a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>1rebel.com/uk</a></p><p id=ebJIKV_QyNNM data-wc=7><strong>Reviewed by: Kate Thomas, Lifestyle Managing Editor</strong></p><h2><strong>F45</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/92685904396d-andrea-hello-f45-fitness-fan.jpg><h3>What is it?</h3><p id=e0MhhFwLCI5 data-wc=40>F45 offers high-intensity functional group workouts that last for 45 minutes and are quick, fun and different every time. Each day is focused on a different type of workout such as resistance-based strength training, cardio or a hybrid of both.</p><h3>What’s it like?</h3><p id=efQopUXta4L data-wc=139>I have been part of the F45 family for over a year, and I fall more in love with it every day. The workouts are tough, and the soreness is real, but my particular gym has great coaches who really care about my journey. They want me to do my exercises properly and they also help with any questions I have about nutrition, such as how to add more protein to my diet etc. It’s not only the coaches though, but the other members also help make it a fun and safe space to disconnect from the real world, every day. Apart from the daily classes, my gym likes to have social days, where we all gather and get to know each other a bit more and have more fun: think picnics, social drinks in the local pub etc.</p><h3>Is it good for beginners?</h3><p id=e_hyTLnhr78 data-wc=41>It’s not easy, but the coaches are there to help you finish the class in one piece. In my personal experience, the first six weeks were tough, and then, as I saw the changes and became stronger, it became more enjoyable.</p><h3>How much is it?</h3><p id=eFtENOxA0Yg data-wc=112>It depends on each studio, as they are franchises and offer different deals. I started off by paying for 12 classes a month and after a year and knowing that I wasn’t going to stop going anytime soon, I got myself a year pass, which obviously ended up being cheaper. Most studios offer a special trial price, so I would suggest starting there and seeing if F45 is for you. If it is, and I am confident it will be, then talk to the manager to try and find the best deal for you. It’s not cheap, but if like me you have no other vices, then this is definitely worth it.</p><p id=epxZexTdYm data-wc=3><a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>f45training.com</a></p><p id=e_BImIWKm8R data-wc=6><strong>Reviewed by: Andrea Caamano, Website Editor</strong></p><h2>HOTPOD YOGA</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/0347bd704795-hot-pod-yoga-london.jpg><h3>What is it?&nbsp;</h3><p id=eqMF1zaYhq data-wc=85>Yoga in 37 degree heat in a giant purple tent. The practice is Vinyasa Flow, a yoga style that synchronises movement and breath, helping work the body and calm the mind. Hot yoga benefits improving your flexibility, bone density, and cardiovascular fitness. It's meant to burn a lot more calories than regular yoga, but the mental benefits for me are key. I find it reduces stress, helps clear my mind for the challenging day ahead, or relaxes me at the end of a busy day.</p><p id=eaNEGpnK6p data-wc=62>All you need is a mat, a towel to mop up your sweat and a water bottle - rehydration is key. Classes also include Nurturing Flow (perfect for relaxing at the end of the day) and Dynamic Flow (to work up even more of a sweat), but I find the regular Hotpod Flow to be the perfect mix of dynamic and zen.</p><h3>What's it like?</h3><p id=eB4EQlCCBvIL data-wc=110>A big sweaty hug. The giant purple tent is one of the most relaxing places on earth; the room is dark, the air is filled with essential oils and a jangly soundtrack accompanies the flow. Hotpod is now so integral to my weekly routine that I find myself feeling anxious if I miss entering a meditative state and the chance to sweat out all my worries. The temperature is high so be warned - if you don't like being hot and clammy, it's probably not for you. As a very sweaty human, I love the fact it's dimly lit, reducing any embarrassment from beads of perspiration dripping off your body.</p><h3>Is it good for beginners?</h3><p id=eB16MbK8xLN7 data-wc=79>Absolutely. Every class begins post warm-up with the teacher talking you through the three basic levels of Vinyasa so first-timers are always able to follow along. The vibe is very much moving at your own pace and only doing what you feel comfortable with, while more experienced yogis are given space to try advanced moves they might be working on. I was a complete yoga novice before trying Hotpod and now I can't get enough of a Downward Dog.</p><h3>How much is it?</h3><p id=e7wpWWPwoq7j data-wc=60>A mini membership is currently £48 per month for one class per calendar week (an excellent deal pre-cost of living increases), and £120 per month for unlimited classes. Otherwise, it's £18 for a single class pass. They have some amazing intro offers like £22 for 10 Days Unlimited at select studios so it's worth keeping an eye out for deals.</p><p id=eKDpe09F5T data-wc=3><a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>hotpodyoga.com</a></p><p id=efWo6N-gdFp4 data-wc=7><strong>Reviewed by: Kate Thomas, Lifestyle Managing Editor</strong></p><h2>ROWBOTS</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/b01cb6cb38ec-rowbots-fitness-class-london.jpg><h3>What is it?&nbsp;</h3><p id=ezoDssrKC6 data-wc=82>The popular rowing-based exercise classes promise to burn up to 800 calories during 50 minutes of high-intensity, low-impact mental and physical conditioning. Their signature class offers maximum intensity training, with split intervals between the floor (think burpees, weighted squats and jump lunges) and the rowing machine. Rowbots prides itself on being backed by science – they have an in-house psychologist and classes boast unique themes, integrating psychological, mental conditioning and mindfulness techniques into their classes to help build your stamina and willpower.</p><h3>What's it like?&nbsp;</h3><p id=ei72ce909I data-wc=110>Rowbots is not just a fancy fitness studio with high-tech equipment; it's a place that seamlessly melds physical endurance with mental resilience…The type of class I'd never quite experienced before! Led by an expert instructor, I found that the class had the perfect balance between pushing me to my limits and providing much-appreciated guidance. The studio boasts state-of-the-art rowing equipment and well-maintained facilities, ensuring a seamless workout experience. What's more, Rowbots created an environment where individuals (like myself) of all fitness levels could challenge themselves and support one another in their fitness journey. After the class was done, I left feeling impressed and that I had achieved something quite challenging.&nbsp;</p><h3>Is it good for beginners?&nbsp;</h3><p id=eEUSF7N0pa data-wc=67>In short… no. While the class pushed me to my limits and the instructor was very encouraging, allowing me to do as much as I felt comfortable with and suggesting adaptations where necessary, it was definitely not suitable for anyone brand new to exercise. However, for those looking to challenge themselves, it's a fantastic option to get you moving and break you out of your comfort zone.&nbsp;</p><h3>How much is it?&nbsp;</h3><p id=eMEy_D_vkO data-wc=36>A single class will set you back £24 or you can buy a bundle of £69 for three. The cheapest deal is £12 for an Express 30-minute lunchtime class, which for London is pretty decent value.</p><p id=ep7QwGIxuN data-wc=3><a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>rowbots.co.uk</a></p><p id=el0kcNXW8Opy data-wc=7><strong>Reviewed by: Sharnaz Shahid, Deputy Online Editor&nbsp;</strong></p><h2>Reform RX at White City House</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/0947f3bd870f-reform-rx-fitness.jpg><h3>What is it?</h3><p id=eE67CRDiWqB data-wc=48>Reform RX has been dubbed the "evolution of Pilates". Founded by husband and wife duo Neal and Yvette McGaffin, the aim is to make access to Reformer classes as easy as possible thanks to a digitally connected Pilates reformer. I tried it at the exclusive White City House.</p><h3>What's it like?</h3><p id=egnC9zakScm data-wc=126>Seamless to use. I took my time to get myself set up on the machine, exploring the expansive catalogue of (100+) classes on offer and getting to grips with the Reformer. I found the functionality simple to use, while the machine itself was really comfy, clean, and felt premium. Everything you need is at your fingertips; warm ups, cool downs, and everything ranging from quick 20-minute classes to an intense 60-minute session if you really want to feel the burn. Since there's something for every level (broken down by Strength, Cardio and Flexibility), I tried both a shorter beginner workout and a longer intermediate session, which worked my muscles to the max. I found the virtual instructors to be clear and their moves simple to follow.</p><p id=eZ_jJn3soYm data-wc=69>I loved the on-demand nature of it – there's no rushing to avoid missing your class during rush hour or a pesky fine if you need to cancel your session. While I may not have made the most of all the machine had to offer (I couldn't get the Bluetooth connectivity to sync with my phone), I don't doubt I'd be a regular if there was one near me.</p><h3>Is it good for beginners?</h3><p id=eV_BptJDnIj data-wc=101>100 percent! I'm no Reformer Pilates expert, having only tried a bog standard beginners class (which I got bored of after a few sessions) or a high-energy session (which was hard to follow due to the low lighting and pumping music). But Reform RX is perfect for beginners and is an easy way to see whether it's the right exercise for you, taking it slow and at your own pace. I was able to pause my virtual class to check I had got the positioning right, and fast forward through one particular exercise that wasn't working for my lower back pain.</p><p id=eA4SUtqnN_ data-wc=19><strong>DISCOVER:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>I am a fitness expert and these 4 simple habits will keep you healthy and strong during menopause</a><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h3>How much is it?&nbsp;</h3><p id=ebXgByZOpF data-wc=14>The RX machine at White City House can be accessed by Soho House members.</p><p id=echAPdpRZH data-wc=5></p><p id=ef9XnR74rj8K data-wc=7><strong>Reviewed by: Kate Thomas, Lifestyle Managing Editor</strong></p><h2><strong>REFORMCORE</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/55a6aa179d96-img1583.jpg><h3>What is it?</h3><p id=e7jZKr1wK5o data-wc=35>From the experts who brought you Barrecore, this reformer pilates class is sure to leave your body burning. The class is specifically curated for power, strength and core-fitness using reformer pilates machines and other equipment.&nbsp;</p><h3>What’s it like?</h3><p id=eP591RttNgG data-wc=128>As a former dancer, I thought I was going to walk in and find the class a breeze and I couldn't have been more wrong. It was one of the most challenging classes I have ever participated in. As someone who usually does HIIT workouts and running, it was a complete change of pace. Rather than crashing through a 30-second set, each exercise is performed slowly and deeply for maximum effect. It opened my eyes to all elements of my fitness and strength that need work and made me really think about how I'm going to be able to build Reformer Pilates into my regular workout routine. I love that it trains your muscles whilst also aiding flexibility as this is something I have lost over the years.&nbsp;</p><h3>Is it good for beginners?</h3><p id=eILbYlUiR2C data-wc=84>Whilst I found it incredibly hard, the instructor was with me the entire session and at the beginning of class explained that if you have to come out of an exercise it doesn't matter, all that matters is that you try your best which was encouraging. I also noticed that even the ladies in my class who had done reformer pilates before struggled at times which shows what a brilliant workout it is, so as a beginner I felt incredibly comfortable despite my shaking!</p><h3>How much is it?</h3><p id=eztQ6BnUepfX data-wc=115>The prices for the class vary and there are several ways you can sign up. The first is with a membership and there is a special discounted offer if it's your first time which is £49 for four classes. After that, you can join onto their normal monthly memberships which start at £110 a month for four classes a month to £240.00 for unlimited classes. Instead of a membership, you can buy blocks of classes if you don't want to commit to annual payments classes start at £30 for one class, to £410 for a block of 20 sessions. You can also book the classes through class pass where memberships start at £39 a month.</p><p id=e7EcxtF_38Pt data-wc=3><a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Reformcore.com</a></p><p id=eYVVc_qGXAF4 data-wc=5><strong>Reviewed by: Isabelle Casey, Reporter&nbsp;</strong></p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
