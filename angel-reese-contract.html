The Lousiana State University student was just drafted to the Chicago Sky and she’s earning less money than she did in college.</p><p>On April 15, 2024, she was the 7th pick of the 2024 WNBA draft for the Chicago Sky. “Knowing the conversations were so good and [Teresa Weatherspoon] felt like a mother to me,” Reese said during the ceremony. “Being able to be a Black woman and <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://stylecaster.com/lists/shohei-ohtani-contract-breakdown/>as a head coach</a>, and everything she’s done at the NBA level, I just knew everything they were bringing to the table. Jeff [Pagliocca], the GM, was amazing, too, and player development is something that I was looking for and they looked for in me. I’m super excited for this move, and I’m just looking forward to getting to Chicago.”</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/NCAA-Womens-Basketball-2.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/caitlin-clark.png><p><a href=# id=auto-tag_angel-reese data-tag=angel-reese>Angel Reese</a> rose to college basketball stardom when she transferred to LSU from Maryland and helped the school achieve their&nbsp;first national championship, where she was Most Outstanding Player.
