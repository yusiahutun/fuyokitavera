I don't want those crazies—because that's what they are—I just don't want them talking about him. It's sad, because you meet the loveliest people who are fans of the show and they're super supportive and they do the nicest things—and then you have that little thing, which just taints it," she explained.</p><p>Caitríona also touched on her desire to diversify the "Outlander" set by creating more opportunities for gender equality --- something she has been working on with her co-star Heughan.</p><p>The article revealed that the 42-year-old actress had noticed the lack of women on the crew of "Outlander".</p><p>This apparent disparity was so wide and noticeable that two years ago she and Heughan spoke with the show's executives about creating opportunities on set that would diversify the crew in terms of gender and race.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:d95afaf6-2cf1-4c56-8bf8-026e69d71797 data-container-ref=toofab:article:32c8b948-a625-47a4-8132-cb793b5e65d9 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/99/5by4/2022/01/05/991a3dcfb0584bf9a953b92d8a0bed4f_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Instagram</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Heidi Montag Opens Up About Her Struggle To Conceive A Second Child</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>"I think on one hand there's sort of this idea, 'Well, Scotland's a very predominantly white place and it's an industry that traditionally is much more male-skewed, so it's tough to find these people,'" she explained. "I'm not sure that's necessarily true. I think there's ways of finding people to bring in."</p><p>Since having her own child, becoming a mother has also given the actress some insight as to why she believes productions are typically male dominated.</p><p>"By the time you get to a certain age, if you want to have a family at all, you end up stepping off that ladder and I think it’s very hard for them to come back in," she continued. "That's something we need to address as an industry because I look at our camera crew, all amazing guys, all of them have become fathers in the eight years we've been filming, but not one of them has had to give up their position."</p><a id=gallery-link-0ae9b8d1-be94-4770-8d62-3645739fae7b class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:0ae9b8d1-be94-4770-8d62-3645739fae7b data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:32c8b948-a625-47a4-8132-cb793b5e65d9 data-gallery-layout=carousel><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/1f/4by3/2022/01/06/1fcd350491e8472b8cb2d0edb4450272_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3N7j2pmaW5fmK6qwNGipqeZXZeurbLEZquapJuoeqS%2BwLOgnqtdqLWqvM%2BipaBlo5a6brTErp6hmZ5k</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
