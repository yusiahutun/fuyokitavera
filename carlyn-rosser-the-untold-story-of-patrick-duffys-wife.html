Patrick Duffy is an American actor and director who got his big break for his role as Bobby Ewing on the CBS primetime soap opera “Dallas” from 1978 to 1985. The iconic actor starred in several films and rose to fame for his outstanding performance.&nbsp;</p><p>Duffy has built a successful career spanning nearly five decades. The renowned actor has appeared in several movies and TV Shows, including “Mistletoe Secret,” “Man From Atlantis,” “Welcome to Sweden,” and the classic “The Bold and the Beautiful.” Although Carlyn Rosser was not a mainstream celebrity, she gained widespread recognition thanks to her husband’s fame and success.</p><p>Rosser and Duffy had one of the greatest marriages in Hollywood that stood the test of time. Their marriage lasted over four decades; many believed it would last forever. However, their marriage ended when tragedy struck, and Rosser died. This loss has prompted several unanswered questions about the actor’s late wife.</p><p>Here’s everything we know about Carlyn Rosser.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/photo_2023-08-18_02-04-31-fotor-202308182839.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_Is_Carlyn_Rosser></span>Who Is Carlyn Rosser?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>According to reports, Rosser was born in July 1939 in Charleston County, South California, United States. However, there are no details regarding her early life and upbringing. In addition, details about her parents and siblings elude the media. However, reports suggest that her nephew is former Major League Baseball pitcher Barry Zito.</p><p>Although Carlyn Rosser is best known as the wife of Hollywood actor Patrick Duffy, she had an established career before meeting the movie star. She worked as a ballet dancer and danced with the First Chamber Dance Company of New York. Aside from being an accomplished ballerina, Rosser was a ball of talent.</p><p>She had a perfect pitch and played the concert piano. In addition, she lived an artistic life and later influenced her husband with her incredible eye for art. According to Duffy, his late wife was so passionate about art that she bought an art piece with her entire weekly salary, which eventually became the first art piece he ever held. With time, their collection grew, and she made a gallery in their home.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/photo_2023-08-18_02-04-41-fotor-2023081821238-1-1024x673.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=How_Did_Patrick_Duffy_and_Carlyn_Rosser_Meet></span>How Did Patrick Duffy and Carlyn Rosser Meet?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Rosser met the man who would later become her husband on a tour bus. She was already an accomplished ballet dancer. However, Duffy had just graduated from college and was touring as a narrator with a dance production company. According to the renowned actor, it was love at first sight, and he instantly knew she was the one.</p><p>When they met, Carlyn Rosser was a married woman ten years older than Duffy. However, despite her age difference and marital status, the actor revealed that he fell in love with her art. Since Rosser and her then-husband, Dale Roy Muchmore, had been together for over 13 years, telling him she had met someone else proved difficult.&nbsp;</p><p>Consequently, the late ballerina was in a dilemma. Since she also shared a special bond with Duffy, she couldn’t imagine being without him. Eventually, Carlyn Rosser told her then-husband about her newfound lover, and despite feeling betrayed, he let her go. Since the age difference didn’t bother the new lovebirds, they tied the knot in 1974.</p><p>Afterward, they decided to live near Eaglepoint on their ranch in Jackson County, Oregon, with their sons, Padraic and Conor. According to Duffy, Rosser’s only rule about choosing their home was that it had to be pretty. Hence, the couple built a beautiful home. In addition, due to Rosser’s love of art, they created a personal American Art Collection inside their home.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/photo_2023-08-18_02-04-36-fotor-202308182655.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_Happened_to_Patrick_Duffys_Wife></span>What Happened to Patrick Duffy’s Wife?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Carlyn Rosser died in 2017, shocking her family. In an interview, Duffy spoke about the day she died. He stated that as much as he tried to adjust to the circumstances, he was concerned about their two sons, who were deeply affected by their mom’s death.&nbsp;</p><p>Six months after Carlyn Rosser’s death, her husband took to Twitter to pay her a sweet tribute in a <a href=#>Tweet</a>. In addition, he thanked his fans for the love and support they showed his family during the difficult time. Duffy also stated that even though his wife was gone, they would be together eternally.</p><p>While Patrick Duffy’s wife, Carlyn Rosser’s cause of death is unclear, reports suggest that the “Dallas” star’s wife lost her battle with <a href=#>cancer</a>. However, these reports remain unconfirmed. Following Rosser’s death, the actor spent most of his time as a widower, raising their sons until he was ready to move on.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/photo_2023-08-18_02-03-31-fotor-202308182948-683x1024.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_Is_Patrick_Duffys_New_Wife></span>Who Is Patrick Duffy’s New Wife?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Although Carlyn Rosser’s husband has found love again after a few years, he is yet to tie the knot with his new partner. He began dating veteran actress Linda Purl during the COVID-19 pandemic when they were in Canada. The couple quarantined in Canada for two weeks, cooked together, and even did joint workouts.&nbsp;</p><p>While in Canada, the two captured many memories and shared them on Instagram. Duffy and Purl have been dating for two years and are still going strong. Aside from being lovers, they also enjoy working together.&nbsp;</p><p>Like <a href=#>Steve Wallis’ wife</a>, Duffy has asserted in many interviews that although Carlyn Rosser is gone, she will forever remain in his heart.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51ksKK%2By7KlZqqfqMCmvoytn55lpaPBsLjDZqqtp6KuerCyjKmYraqZmLhusNSfnbKrXay2p7GO</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
