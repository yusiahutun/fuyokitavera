But she still has some insecurities, and is even hesitant to step out in public with no makeup on. In fact, it's makeup that has actually given the country singer some of her confidence back!</p><p>"Makeup is a confidence builder for me. When I want to look hot, I like smoky eyes and eyeliner," the 35-year-old recently explained to <a href=# title=_blank>People</a>. "I just feel like it’s nice to have things that enhance the things you like and cover up the things you don’t. I like walking by a mirror and I’m like, 'Ok! I feel like I’m put together. Alright!'"</p><p>Even before her accident, Carrie was a big proponent of wearing makeup. "I don’t think I ever have makeup-free days, to be honest. I wear makeup for me. I don’t want to walk by a mirror and feel like I haven’t given some sort of effort. I just feel better when I have a little on," she previously told <a href=# title=_blank>Yahoo!</a>.</p><p>The "Before He Cheats" singer continued to <a href=# title=_blank>People</a>, "I’ll always put makeup on, even if it’s just a little bit. If I’m going someplace, I always think, 'Somebody’s going to see me and want to take a picture with me,' which is really great, but I hate it when I see the pictures later when I wasn’t wearing any makeup at all. So I’ll throw on a little bit. I won’t feel bad about my pictures if I do that."</p><p>Carrie finally showed off her face on Sunday, April 15, when she performed "Cry Pretty" at the <a href=#>ACM awards</a>. But the songstress was <a href=#>allegedly "terrified"</a> for people to see her new facial scars before she hit the stage. "She ended up skipping the red carpet because she didn’t want to be bombarded with questions about the accident," an insider explained to People. "It’s the most shaken anyone has ever seen her… this whole ordeal. She was terrified of people seeing the scars. Her hair and makeup team must’ve been under so much pressure."</p><p>Even though the mom-of-one warned her fans that her face "<a href=#>might look a bit different</a>," many commented that she actually doesn't look changed at all — her scars were hardly even noticable! While this angered some, others were super supportive of Carrie as she gradually made her comeback from the serious injury. "Welcome back to where you belong with your beautiful song and beautiful YOU," one fan wrote in the comments section of an <a href=#>Instagram photo</a>, and another commented, "Carrie you will always be beautiful!!! Beauty comes from within."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46cmKuqmZp6trrDnqmwp5%2BZeq%2B7jKaYpJ2lpXpygZdwbGxn</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
