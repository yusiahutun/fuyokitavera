On the small screen, Foster has proven his skills in other shows like Zero Hour, Chasing Life, and Crazy Ex-Girlfriend.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Scott Michael Foster Dating/Girlfriend/Wife</strong></h2><p>Lately, Foster has become very secretive about his love life. “I intend to keep my private life out of public scrutiny,” he told the media. However, in the past, Foster has had two known relationships. The first was in 2007 with his Greek co-star Spencer Grammer.</p><p>Fans of the hit series would agree that the chemistry between them on screen was simply undeniable. Foster was 21 years old at the time, while Grammer was 23.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Scott-and-Spencer.jpg><p>The fans were particularly enthusiastic about their relationship, as everything seemed like a fairy tale come true. But the couple couldn’t quite keep it together when they split up in 2008 and shattered the hearts of Greek fans.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Alicia Cargile Wiki, Net Worth, Dating, Lesbian, Girlfriend</a></strong></p><p>While Grammer previously married James Hesketh and married in 2011, Foster found love in the eyes of That 70s show star actress Laura Prepon in 2008, who is now known for Orange Is The New Black. Scott seems to like her a little more mature than him, as Laura was older than him with an age difference of 5 years.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Scott-and-Laura.jpg><p>Their relationship lasted about five years before they separated in 2013 for reasons unknown to the media. Like Scott, Laura keeps her private life to herself when it comes to her personal life. Although she became a star as a teenager, she was never foddering for the tabloids. She once said to Marie Claire, “I’m not going to spend my day updating my social media. I want to enjoy and live my life. I want to let people in, I want the fans to know what I’m doing, but there’s also a lot of things I keep close to the vest.”</p><p>However, the paparazzi managed to get a glimpse of their outings while they were together.</p><p>Three years after her breakup with Foster, People reported in October 2016 that she was engaged to Ben Foster. The news came as a shock to the media, who were unaware of an existing relationship between them.</p><p>Like his long-time ex-girlfriend, Scott Foster decided to remain over-private in terms of his dating life. Perhaps the news of his engagement would also appear shockingly on the news.
