I booked myself in with Dr Sangha a few weeks later to get my tooth removed.</p><p>"I was nervous about the extraction, but was looking forward to not being in any pain! Dr Sangha numbed my mouth, but it really hurt when she was trying to take out my tooth.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

If the dentist had carried out the adequate treatment in the first place, her problems could have been avoided."</p><p>The Dental Law Partnership took on Ms Leck's case in 2018.
