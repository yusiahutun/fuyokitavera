Wondering where to watch the <a href=# id=auto-tag_grammys data-tag=grammys>Grammys</a> this year? Keep reading for our tips on the best and one of the only ways to stream the Grammys live for free in 2024.</p><p>The <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Grammys</a>, which were originally known as the Gramophone Awards, started in 1959 as a way to honor artists and executives in the music industry in the same way that movies and television have the Oscars and the Emmys. The <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://stylecaster.com/entertainment/music/1259598/how-to-watch-grammys/ rel="noreferrer noopener">first Grammys</a> were held on May 4, 1959, at the Beverly Hilton Hotel in Beverly Hills, California, as well as the Park Sheraton Hotel in New York City. However, it wasn’t until later that year, at the second Grammys, that the show was televised for the first time. Its first live telecast was with the 13th Grammys in 1971.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Outlander.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Outlander.jpg><p>Since the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Grammys</a> started more than 60 years ago, thousands of artists have received the coveted award: a gold-plated, gilded gramophone trophy made of zinc alloy. Though there are more than 80 categories across more than 25 fields and music genres, the Grammys are best known for their “General Field” categories (also known as the Big Four categories): Album of the Year; Record of the Year; Song of the Year; and Best New Artist. “Artists will often see a boost in album sales and streaming numbers after taking home a Grammy in what’s called a ‘Grammy bump,’ but the size of the bump often correlates with how many awards are collected and when in the ceremony the wins occur,” <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Billboard</a> reported in 2022 of the significant of the Grammys. “Generally, primetime award wins and showstopping performances during the main telecast will yield bigger gains.”</p><p>The 66th annual Grammy Awards in 2024 includes nominees like Taylor Swift, Billie Eilish, Olivia Rodrigo, Dua Lipa, and Jon Batiste. The award show will be hosted by comedian Trevor Noah, who has hosted the Grammys three times prior. “The first thing I’ve learned is that all your preparation is really just the parachute for what actually happens on the night because anything can happen, and every single year it somehow does,” Noah told <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://people.com/grammys-2024-trevor-noah-jokes-he-only-hosts-in-hopes-of-winning-one-exclusive-8553343 rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">People</a> in January 2024. “I’ve also learned that because it’s a celebration of these musicians and what they’ve done, everyone is there to party and have a good time. So, as the host, I’m constantly navigating the room. There’s people walking by when I’m trying to do stuff. There are people who are catching up with their friends while I’m trying to move the show along.”</p><p>So where can music fans stream the Grammys?

The arena, which was previously known as the Staples Center until it was renamed in December 2021, was also the venue for the 65th annual Grammy Awards in 2023.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=who-s-the-grammys-2024-host>Who’s the Grammys 2024 host?</h2><p>The Grammys 2024 host is Trevor Noah, a comedian and former host of The Daily Show. The 66th Grammy Awards is the fourth time Noah has hosted the Grammys after 2023, 2022, and 2021. Noah is also nominated at the 2024 Grammys in the Best Comedy Album category for I Wish You Would.</p><p>“I’m glad that it’s happening in my fourth year [hosting the awards], because I think in my first year, that would’ve been an emotional overload,” he told <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/music-news/trevor-noah-grammys-host-interview-award-shows-comedy-album-1235810268/ rel="noreferrer noopener">The Hollywood Reporter</a> in January 2024. Being nominated for a Grammy is so momentous that I don’t know how you could focus on hosting a show at the same time. And hosting the show is so much stress and there’s so much that’s happening live that you don’t want to be distracted by this idea that you may or may not win an award. This is may be the perfect time for it to happen.”</p><p>He also looked back at his first nomination in the category for Son of Patricia in 2020. “I’m nominated alongside my heroes: Wanda Sykes, Chris Rock and Dave Chappelle. I don’t ever take those moments for granted. I think to myself how crazy it is to even be in the same category as these people,” he said. “When I was thinking of [doing] comedy, Dave Chappelle was already an accomplished comedian. When I was thinking of starting to maybe tell somebody a joke, Chris Rock was already one of the biggest comedians in the world, and the same goes for Wanda Sykes. So I have never been somebody who is in a rush to win or to be thought of as the best at anything. I’m really, really, really not even saying this just to be humble or anything. I’m really happy and grateful to just be in that company.”</p><p>As for who he’s rooting for this year, Noah named Beyonce, who made history as the artist with the most awards in Grammys history at the 2023 show, as one nominee he can’t wait to see.</p><p>“I would hope that something like that could happen. Any time history can be made, I’m always in favor of it because I always think, ‘If you can just knock down that first domino, then hopefully the rest follow.’ And so I’m always rooting for people to break records,” he said. “I’m rooting for Beyoncé to break the most wins. I’m rooting for Taylor Swift to win the most albums. I’m rooting for SZA to become the first—. There’s just something magical about seeing somebody’s journey culminate in the making of history. What’s tough about these categories is that almost every single person in them is someone who I believe deserves to win that award. And that’s the one thing that sucks about awards is that not everybody can win.”</p><p>Though he’s the host, Noah also confirmed that he doesn’t vote for awards. “I’m not part of the voting contingency, and I’m actually glad because then nobody can come up to me and say, ‘Who did you vote for? What did you do?’ Luckily, I don’t have that stress on my shoulders.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=who-are-the-grammys-2024-performers>Who are the Grammys 2024 performers?</h2><p>See below for a list of Grammys 2024 and who’s performing the main and premiere ceremony.</p><p>Grammys Premiere Ceremony Performers</p><ul><li>Adam Blackstone</li><li>Brandy Clark</li><li>Gaby Moreno</li><li>Harvey Mason</li><li>J.
