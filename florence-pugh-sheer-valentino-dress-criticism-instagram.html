Acknowledging that she knew there would be commentary surrounding the dress, she was still "excited" to wear it. But Pugh didn't expect the level of disrespect and vulgarity from critics.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Getty</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_6-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"What's been interesting to watch and witness is just how easy it is for men to totally destroy a woman's body, publicly, proudly, for everyone to see," she wrote alongside a slideshow of photos of her show-stopping look. "You even do it with your job titles and work emails in your bio..?" She added, "It isn't the first time and certainly won't be the last time a woman will hear what's wrong with her body by a crowd of strangers, what's worrying is just how vulgar some of you men can be."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Pugh revealed that she's already accepted her so-called "flaws" that people have "aggressively" wanted to point out to her. "I've lived in my body for a long time," she said. "I'm fully aware of my breast size and am not scared of it." She then turned the tables back onto the critics, questioning, "What's more concerning is…. Why are you so scared of breasts? Small? Large? Left? Right? Only one? Maybe none? What. Is. So. Terrifying. It makes me wonder what happened to you to be so content on being so loudly upset by the size of my boobs and body..?"</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I'm very grateful that I grew up in a household with very strong, powerful, curvy women," Pugh continued. "We were raised to find power in the creases of our body. To be loud about being comfortable. It has always been my mission in this industry to say 'fuck it and fuck that' whenever anyone expects my body to morph into an opinion of what's hot or sexually attractive."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Her post concluded with a reminder to "respect people. Respect bodies. Respect all women. Respect humans." "Life will get a whole lot easier, I promise," she wrote. "And all because of two cute little nipples…."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Valentino's creative director Pierpaolo Piccioli supported Pugh's message in the comments section, writing: "Respect." Joey King also piled on the praise. "You are truly so amazing," she wrote. "You put into words what so many feel but can't articulate." Jameela Jamil added, "You're a magical fucking queen and we do not deserve you."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Say it louder for the people in the back.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57wp6jnpqinsG6e8WlpqudnpiybrzUoJ9mq5iasrN51ZqjnqaknruwecOrnKyrXZi%2FqsDInKCspV2eu7TAwKCpmqU%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
