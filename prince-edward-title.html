The Duke of Edinburgh has been stepping up in the wake of the monarch’s cancer battle, and it appears those efforts have not gone unnoticed, earning him a special new distinction handed down by the king himself.</p><p>Prince Edward has received a new title as a member of the prestigious Order of the Thistle. He showcased his regalia for the title for the first time during a public appearance on April 12, 2024, while attending the dedication for a new vessel in Leith, Scotland, per <a rel=nofollow href=#>Us Weekly</a>. The 60-year-old royal, who also serves as the Commodore in Chief of the Royal Fleet Auxiliary, donned his ceremonial military uniform adorned with a silver medal featuring a gold emblem, symbolizing his new membership in the Order of the Thistle.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/kentucky-derby-2.jpeg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/buffing-bar.jpg><p>He was appointed to the order in March 2024 by his older brother King Charles, in celebration of his 60th birthday. “On the occasion of The Duke of Edinburgh’s 60th birthday tomorrow, His Majesty The King has been graciously pleased to appoint His Royal Highness to the Most Ancient and Most Noble Order of the Thistle,” the <a href=# id=auto-tag_royal-family data-tag=royal-family>royal family</a> shared in a statement via&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>X</a> on March 9, 2024.</p><p>The Order of the Thistle is an ancient and prestigious order of chivalry in Scotland. The order, which was established in 1687 by King James VII of Scotland (James II of England) is considered one of the highest honors that can be bestowed upon someone in Scotland. The order consists of the sovereign and 16 knights and ladies, who are appointed by the sovereign to honor outstanding contributions to Scotland or to the monarch personally. Members of the Order of the Thistle are known for their service to the nation and the monarch.</p><p>The news of Prince Edward’s title comes amid not only <a href=# data-type=post data-id=1717400>Charles’ battle with cancer</a> but also as his nephew, Prince William, has taken a step back from royal duties while his wife, Kate Middleton, undergoes cancer treatment of her own. The Telegraph previously reported that&nbsp;<a href=#>Prince Edward</a>&nbsp;is shaping up to be the royal family’s new “<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>leading man</a>” amidst these struggles. Ever since the king was diagnosed with cancer, Edward has reportedly taken up&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>297 royal engagements</a>&nbsp;in 2023, the most taken by a royal family member right behind his brother Charles and sister, Princess Anne, per The Independent. Evidently, all of his hard work is being recognized.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/king-charles-inherit.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Endgame-Novel.jpg><p><span class="_text_y7yck_1 _text_153t8_1" data-component=text data-alias data-alignment data-theme=product-price data-transform data-truncate>$23.14</span><span class="_text_y7yck_1 _text_153t8_1" data-component=text data-alias=buy-now__original-price data-alignment data-theme=product-price-strikethrough data-transform data-truncate>$32.00</span><span class="_text_y7yck_1 _text_153t8_1" data-component=text data-alias data-alignment data-theme=product-percentage-off data-transform data-truncate>28% Off</span></p><p><a data-pmc-sp-product=1c1ce601f19e543c69cfabcfb0dc7dad href=# custom-ga-data='{"1pd":true,"category":"article-page","details":"Endgame","label":"buy-now","event_type_label":"Affiliate","url":true,"product":{"dimension1":"%=href=%","name":"Endgame: Inside the Royal Family and the Monarchy&#39;s Fight for Survival","price":"16.68","id":"0063258668","category":"Europe"},"id":1751916,"location":true}' custom-ga-track=click rel=nofollow>Endgame</a> , the explosive book from longtime royal journalist Omid Scobie and author of the international blockbuster&nbsp;Finding Freedom,&nbsp;is a penetrating investigation into the current state of the British monarchy—an unpopular king, a power-hungry heir to the throne, a queen willing to go to dangerous lengths to preserve her image, and a prince forced to start a new life after&nbsp;being betrayed by his own family.”</p><p>Queen Elizabeth II’s death ruptured the already-fractured foundations of the House of Windsor—and dismantled the protective shield around it. With an institution long plagued by antiquated ideas around race, class and money, the monarchy and those who prop it up are now exposed and at odds with a rapidly modernizing world. Relying on his vast experience as a royal reporter and over a decade of conversations and interviews with current and former Palace staff, trusted friends of the royals and even the family members themselves, Scobie pulls back the curtain on an institution in turmoil to show what the monarchy must change in order to survive.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2iblaGyo77IrbBmppWswHB9lm5ocmlmZL2ztc2cnGadlKyus7CMraCtpJVk</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
