Chemmy explained: “It’s been the most amazing thing to come out of something so horrific.</p><p>“I couldn’t have got back on the slopes this year without the show. Mentally it has been brilliant for me, just getting back into the grind of training and learning something new.</p><p>“And you have to be so mentally strong for the skate-offs.</p><p>“My problems in my career as a ski racer was that I was mentally quite weak and I broke down a few times, especially when I had a good run and I had expectations.</p><p>“Dancing On Ice has made me realise I can be strong. I’ve never had the mental strength before but in this show, I’ve had to show it.</p><p>“It’s a massive turning point for me. I think my comeback could be special.</p><p>“The Olympics will be the end of my career and of course I want to leave with a gold medal.</p><p>“I’m the only person to come into Dancing On Ice to have less injuries at the end than at the beginning.</p><p>“I’ve always thought being girlie distracts from the sport, but I now know I was wrong.</p><p>“If you look good and feel confident then you are going to perform better.</p><p>“So if I’m at the start gate and feel like a glamorous champion then I think it will be easier for me to be that champion.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCsrJGne6S7ja6iaKymZLGiusKipaBlmZiybrXCnmSmmZSaeqS0xKaksmVhbYJzfZdvbw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
