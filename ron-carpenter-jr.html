Who is Ron Carpenter’s wife?</p><h2><strong>Introduction</strong></h2><p>Ron Carpenter is an American pastor who founded Redemption World Outreach Center in 1991.</p><h2><strong>Biography</strong></h2><p>He was born on January 20, 1970.</p><p>Ron went to Belton-Honea Path High School in Anderson County.</p><h2><strong>Redemption World Outreach Center</strong></h2><p>In 1991, Carpenter and his wife, Hope, founded Redemption World Outreach Center with just 3 people and “a passion for breaking down the walls of racism, crossing cultural lines, and changing poverty mindsets.”</p><p>He was 22 when he and his wife started Redemption.</p><p>Ron said:</p><p><strong>“I graduated college, moved here and started a church. This is all I’ve ever done.”</strong></p><p>The megachurch was named Redemption Church, and it includes 5 campuses and active membership of more than 25,000 people.</p><h2><strong>Jubilee Christian Center</strong></h2><p>In 2017, the megachurch pastor said that he was stepping down from Redemption of Greenville and moving his ministry to California to take over Jubilee Christian Center in San Jose, replacing Dick Bernal.</p><p>Ron also said that he had been considering the change for 2 years.</p><p><a href=#>John Gray</a> took over leadership of the Church, leading it under the name ‘Relentless.’ There was even a ceremonial gesture when Ron gave a key to John that unlocks every door in the 250,000-square-foot building.</p><p>Ron wrote on his Facebook account:</p><p><strong>“Pray for Pastor John and Aventer (his wife) as they take on leadership in what I believe is one of the greatest churches in America.”</strong></p><p><strong>Note</strong> – John Gray is a former associate pastor at <a href=#>Joel Osteen</a>’s Lakewood Church in Houston.</p><p>In December 2018, Gray grabbed national and local headlines after he gifted his wife a Lamborghini Urus, a luxury SUV that is valued at more than $240,000.</p><p>The Lamborghini Urus is one of the fastest SUVs in the world, with the capacity to go from 0 to 60 mph in under 3.6 seconds.</p><p>Gray said he was able to purchase the Lamborghini Urus because of revenue from – his investments and savings, a reality show on the Oprah Winfrey Network (named – The Book of John Gray), and his book deal (titled – Win from Within: Finding Yourself by Facing Yourself).</p><p>John Gray said:</p><p><strong>“The stories that I hear, and I’ve tried to not listen to it, but one of them is, ‘Pastor buys his wife, you know, this expensive car.’”&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The pastor continued:</p><p><strong>“First of all, it wasn’t a pastor that bought the car. It was a husband that bought the car.”</strong></p><p>In March 2019, Gray suggested churchgoers to help bankroll a $250,000 repair to the church’s roof. He also said the money could be raised if 2,500 people gave $100. The pastor offered to pay $300 himself.</p><p>In January 2019, it was reported that Gray and his wife live in a $1.8 million home funded by Relentless Church. Officials at the church stated that the home was included in a compensation package for his work at the church.</p><p>Travis Hayes, chief financial officer for Relentless Church, stated:</p><p><strong>“This is not anything new. This is a practice that is done with every denomination in the nation.”</strong></p><p>Travis Hayes later added:</p><p><strong>”That’s what this is. This is an asset that belongs to the church.”</strong></p><h2><strong>Book</strong></h2><p>On January 17, 2012, Ron published a book entitled – ”The Necessity of an Enemy: How the Battle You Face Is Your Best Opportunity.”</p><p><strong>READ MORE: </strong><a href=#>Facts about Rebecca Skloot</a></p><h2><strong>Wife</strong></h2><p>Ron Carpenter is married to Hope Carpenter.</p><p>Carpenter said that he and Hope were raised in military families; therefore, the flag and the national anthem are sacred to them.</p><p>In 2013, his wife was forced to go to rehab after it was revealed that Hope was involved in multiple extramarital affairs. The pastor was under immense stress due to the fact that he kept his wife’s infidelity a secret for almost 10 years.</p><p>Ron said:</p><p><strong>&nbsp;“I cannot tell you the horror of having something like plutonium inside of me, a secret in me.”</strong></p><p>The pastor later added:</p><p><strong>“And I have to grab a microphone every Sunday and Wednesday and talk to the world, having lost all my confidence, humiliated, shamed, and embarrassed.”</strong></p><p>In 2014, Hope was welcomed back by congregants of Redemption Church.</p><h2><strong>Children</strong></h2><p>The couple has three children.</p><p><strong>READ MORE:&nbsp;</strong><a href=#>Biography of Heather Sanders</a></p><h2><strong>Quotes</strong></h2><p><br>“Jesus is our only answer, and He promotes faith, love, peace, HONOR, and unity and submission!”</p><p>”I have a rich, full life because of my wonderful God.. my wonderful wife and family.”</p><p>“Qualify the people you give your heart to.”</p><p>”Satan asks to put us on trial and accuses us of all that we have done, but then Jesus steps up as our defender.”</p><p>”Even if people are set out to diminish God’s assignment on your life, remember: it’s the purpose of the Lord that prevails.”</p><p>“God always has your best interest in mind.”</p><p>”Are you reading your word to know where to plant your seeds?”</p><p>”My battle is not to get a victory; my battle is to occupy every promise that Jesus purchased for me and said is mine.”</p><p>”Will you be diligent? Will you refuse to quit?”</p><p>”God wants you to talk with Him, but you have to make it a two-way street.”</p><p>”God doesn’t just want to hear you, he wants to commune with you.”</p><p>”The name of Jesus is the greatest authoritative voice on earth.”</p><p>”We have diverse cultures, we have diverse generational age groups, just a diversity of everything.”</p><p><strong>READ MORE:&nbsp;</strong><a href=#>Gwen Ifill Net Worth</a></p><h2><strong>Trivia</strong></h2><p>Other famous pastors in the US are:</p><ul><li><a href=#>Rob Bell</a>;</li><li><a href=#>Greg Locke</a>;</li><li><a href=#>David Platt</a>.</li></ul><h2><strong>Ron Carpenter – Net Worth</strong></h2><p>So, how much is Ron Carpenter worth?</p><p>The pastor earned most of his wealth from being the founder of the Redemption World Outreach Center.</p><p>He also earns some money from selling his books – “So You Think You Want to Fly!” and ”The Necessity of an Enemy.”</p><p>In a recent interview, Ron said that in 2002 – “I had $4 million in the bank.”</p><p>Therefore, American pastor Ron Carpenter has an estimated net worth of $8 million.</p><p><strong>READ THIS NEXT: </strong><a href=#>Who is Miracle Watts?</a></p><pre>References <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.huffpost.com/pastor-john-gray-lamborghini-gift</a> <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.christianpost.com/ron-carpenter-jr-once-sowed-every-dime</a> <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">https://eu.greenvilleonline.com/redemption-church-ron-carpenter-john-gray</a></pre><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiekaK8tr%2FPnqappJWpvKWt2GeaqKVfp7yvecKaqamdnqmys3nJq2Y%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
