If so, who exactly is he?</span></h2><p>According to media reports, NBA reporter Malika Andrews has a boyfriend. Malika, on the other hand, has rarely spoken about her personal life. In the podcast Laughter Permitted with Julie Foudy, she didn’t hesitate to reveal that she has a boyfriend.</p><p>She revealed in the podcast, while discussing New York City with the program host, that when the COVID pandemic began, she was living in New York with her boyfriend. She also stated that she had prepared a question to ask the NBA finals winner alongside her lover.</p><p>Even after mentioning her boyfriend, the ESPN reporter did not reveal his name or any other information about him. Instead, the podcast conversation focused on Malika’s professional life rather than her personal life. People do, however, make assumptions about her secret affair. In addition, here’s a rundown of her rumored boyfriends and dating history.</p><h2><span id=Is_Malika8217s_rumored_boyfriend_Dave_McMenamin_dating_her>Is Malika’s rumored boyfriend Dave McMenamin dating her?</span></h2><p>When Malika appeared alongside her NBA colleague Dave McMenamin in 2022, Twitter was flooded with surprise and curiosity.

One of King Vicious’ Tweeps tweeted,</p><p><strong>The Hypocrisy Exists Dave McMenamin of ESPN and Malika Andrews have a mutually beneficial relationship. Why hasn’t @espn suspended one of them or made their business public like they did coach? #ImeUdoka Is it due to the fact that he is Mr. Clean? Stephen A Smith and Malika Andrews</strong></p><p>Similarly, other Tweeps’ tweets such as,</p><p><strong>Please tell me this isn’t real.</strong></p><p><strong>I’m not sure what’s more shocking… Chris Haynes’ evil twin saying wild shit, or Dave McMenimen having Malika Andrews.</strong></p><p><strong>and many more.</strong></p><p>However, neither Malika nor Dave have addressed the rumor about their relationship to date. We don’t know whether McMenamin is Andrews’ secret boyfriend in this case.
