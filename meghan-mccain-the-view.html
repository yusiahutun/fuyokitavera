I had an experience while I was working at ABC News," she shared, not naming The View by name but adding the incident happened during "a particularly heated Hot Topics meeting."

During her run on the show, she famously came head-to-head with Joy Behar and Whoopi Goldberg, both of whom she would go on to call "mean."</p><p><a href=#><strong>Back in December</strong></a>, she claimed the show's hosts are sent a list of possible topics and "whatever the majority chooses is the topic of the show." The problem, as McCain sees it, is that the majority of the panel is unabashedly liberal.</p><p>"Anything that makes Democrats look bad is never chosen," she said. "I had to go in every morning being like, 'Hey, whatever news story that makes Biden look bad is the number one news story of the day,' and there would be a fight over whether or not it should even be aired because the hosts didn't agree on it."</p><p>"And that was always a battle every day," she continued. "And there were some news stories that they just wouldn't cover because it made people look bad. It's under ABC News and I don't think that's totally ethical."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:04c0c197-1585-440d-9031-46d7ad591406 data-container-ref=toofab:article:801ac60b-515b-4b66-9de5-7cbe55ec8987 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=29><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/94/5by4/2023/10/20/94beb008a7614ff884817b203a73b951_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty / NBC</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Meghan McCain Blasts Seth Meyers Years After Feud, Says Interview Was 'Horrific Experience'</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3V7j21mamhforKotMCnZKabk5a2r3nToZxmrpmaxHA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
