fortune.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'If we spent less money on trying to become carbon neutral, which as a parish council will have absolutely no effect on anything whatsoever, and more on the visual stuff that people actually see - the council won't come under so much scrutiny.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Cllr Hocking said the council is only as good as what residents see when they step out of their front doors.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>He added: 'If you do nothing that the vast majority of your council taxpayers see, the assumption will be that you're not doing a very good job.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'Things like Christmas lights are those annual occasions where you can go wham and have a good time.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Labour Cllr Caroline

George Mall was noticed by visitors.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>One local, Peter Lord, 86, said he would have liked to have seen a big Christmas tree and his wife Carol, 75, added: 'I was a little disillusioned, I must admit.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'It was a shame but maybe if a bit more thought went into it, it could've looked a bit more Christmassy.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Charlotte Copeman, 45, and her family travelled to Salisbury especially for the display and admitted to feeling disappointed by the offerings.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The mother of one said: 'We went to Winchester and had an awesome day out, we also came here to do it today and there's absolutely nothing-we're really surprised, we spoke to some of the store owners and they said they were really disappointed.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>In previous years, Salisbury council have had a big Christmas tree on display in the city centre with a light switch on hosted by a celebrity.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Other frustrated residents took to the Salisbury UK Notice Board Facebook group to share their opinions on the Christmas offerings.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Nikki Wyeth wrote 'Salisbury has lost the festive spirit'; an opinion echoed by Lisa Da Costa, who commented 'Salisbury is just disappointing all together'.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Another local, Samantha Martin, slammed the lack of funding in the markets this year, commenting: 'Christmas happens once a year and it's a big thing for children and families.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'With people having to cut right back because they simply cannot afford them you would think the least the council could do for its residents is make Christmas time extra special.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Chairman of the events, markets and grants sub committee, councillor Sam Charleston, defended the city's offering but said the people of Salisbury will 'see more next year'.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>He said: 'The events we're doing are spread out more across the city.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'I appreciate that all these things are a matter of taste, but I'm very happy with the amount of things that are going on this year.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'I think we will see more next year because that is the process we're undertaking.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Cllr Annie Riddle, who is part of the council's leadership team, said: 'If people want more and they want the council to fund more, they will have to pay more council tax.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'Unless they want another big tax rise, we are doing our best to maintain the level of everyday services which people rely on and people expect from us, and we're doing our very best to provide Christmas festivities at a reasonable cost.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Cllr Riddle added that 'it's no use' wishing for a return of the chalet-style Christmas market, as some of the chalets are no longer fit for purpose and there is 'certainly no money for new ones'.</p><p class=postsid
