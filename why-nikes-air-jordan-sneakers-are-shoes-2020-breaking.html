One episode focused on Air Jordans: how Nike signed “His Airness” and the cultural impact of the shoes.</p>That impact cannot be understated and has expanded this year, from <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">the Netflix show</span></a> <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Sneakerheads</span></a> , which focuses on the sneaker resale market and the search for Air Jordan “Zeroes”, to One Man and His Shoes, a documentary on Nike Jordan shoes and how American teens have killed each other over them (neither Nike nor the Jordan brand took part in that film).This year, high fashion house Dior collaborated with Jordan for the most luxe sneaker ever released. The “Diordan”, as the Air Jordan 1s designed by Dior’s self-professed Jordan fan Kim Jones became known, is 2020’s most wanted shoe, having been first glimpsed at <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Dior Men’s pre-fall show in Miami last December</span></a>.<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2020/11/19/72081f46-293c-11eb-bf26-f2b76f37a526_972x_172805.jpeg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Five million sneakerheads entered the raffle to buy a pair on the Nike website when it went live this June, trying to get their hands on one of the 8,000 pairs of highs (US$2,200) and lows (US$2,000). Good luck finding them for retail prices in the resale market, where a pair on luxury website Farfetch is currently going for US$38,000.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The record did not last long. An August auction at Christie’s saw the game-worn size US13.5 Air Jordan 1s from the “Shattered Backboard” game that same year sell for US$615,000. That came in under the estimate of US$650,000-800,000.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2020/11/19/7d77a482-293c-11eb-bf26-f2b76f37a526_972x_172805.jpeg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The auction, held by Christie’s and retailer Stadium Goods, brought in almost US$1 million, while another auction in August saw memorabilia auctioneers Gotta Have Rock and Roll sell a pair of post-injury 1986 Jordans for almost US$400,000.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Little wonder that Jordans are now seen as an investment, and the market has reacted.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Last year, crowd investment app Rally Road offered a pair of autographed Air Jordans from a 1988 game previously owned by NFL star Jack Ham, initially valued at US$22,000 in US$11 shares. By this July they were trading at US$37 per share or US$74,000, SportTechie.com reported.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Jordans are clearly good for business. Online auction giant eBay has just concluded a week of Air Jordan lots, selling 60 pairs of hard-to-find originals. Last month, sports fashion retailer JD Sports worked with Nike to restock dozens of Air Jordan reissues unavailable elsewhere for the opening of its new flagship store in New York’s Times Square. People wanting to get their hands on a pair had to visit its other stores to enter the raffle.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2020/11/19/a4408d36-293c-11eb-bf26-f2b76f37a526_972x_172805.jpeg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">As well as the impact of Covid-19, 2020 has also been the year of Black Lives Matter. In June, Jordan and the Jordan brand co-pledged US$100 million to the black community as social justice protests rose around the US.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Jordan also spoke out at the death of George Floyd, whose killing at the hands of uniformed police officers began the Black Lives Matter protests.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Whatever else the world has in store, the future is bright for the Jordan brand. To celebrate 25 years of the Air Jordan 11 – the shoe Jordan wore to win the 1996 NBA championships and in the movie Space Jam released the same year – Nike will release two new versions next month.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">One of them is straight out of Back to the Future, literally. The Air Jordan 11 Adapt uses the same self-tying lace technology as used on the Nike MAG in 2016 – shoes based on those worn by Michael J Fox’s character Marty McFly in Back to The Future II.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2020/11/19/a0189e06-293c-11eb-bf26-f2b76f37a526_972x_172805.jpeg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">As for on the court, the Jordan brand has signed up the NBA stars of the next decade: Japan’s Rui Hachimura, Slovenia’s Luka Doncic and America’s Zion Williamson. They have their own signature shoes on the way to drive sales.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Despite retiring in 2003, Jordan remains the best-paid athlete in the shoe game – he has earned US$1.3 billion from the brand since signing in 1984, according to Forbes, and US$130 million of that came last year. That’s four times more than basketball’s current highest-paid shoe endorsee and NBA Finals MVP LeBron James.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The “Be Like Mike” tagline has never been more apt.</p><p>This article appeared in the South China Morning Post print edition as: Year of leaps and bounds</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuaqyxKyrsqSVZLOiv8eipqdlkpqutsDYaJirrJmYuaZ7kmpoaW1kaHy4tNhmpaKjlah6orXRZqGoqpSWu26%2FzZ6YpJ2iqHqivsRmqqGnlah6c3yRaWSbqpWWuKq6xg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
