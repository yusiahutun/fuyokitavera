When Dr. Steve Olusegun&nbsp; OGIDAN left the Bank of Agriculture, BOA-NIGERIA as an employee, the most potent weapon he had was his determination and courage. Entrepreneurs should keep their eye on the big picture during these moments of achievement: There are always key takeaways and lessons from these successes that can guide anyone along your journey.</p><p>“I was inspired by victories along the journey and celebrate all my wins, big and small.”</p><p>The Successory Nigeria Ltd started by dominating its environment in Kaduna State that any firm wishing to come into the space will have to partner with them.

We also hire for passion.”</p><p>The Successory Nigeria Ltd firm’s team members are motivated by the knowledge they get from the team rather than pecuniary gains. Even those young ones without experience come into the team with great determination and incredible work ethics. They operate with a very flat structure with teams.&nbsp;</p><p>Even the youngest of the staff could be designated a team lead in any project. That way, they give responsibilities to the staff with corresponding authority.&nbsp;</p><p>“A leader…is like a shepherd. He stays behind the flock, letting the most nimble go out ahead, whereupon the others follow, not realising that all along they are being directed from behind.”</p><p>Nelson Mandela</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqyr8DEq6eroaOaxLC%2By51lnKedZMC2r8Keqqynoq56r7XGnqmimV2hwaU%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
