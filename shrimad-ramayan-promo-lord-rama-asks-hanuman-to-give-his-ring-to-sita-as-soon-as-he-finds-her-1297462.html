He asks the Monkey God to give it to his ladylove so that she believes him as the messenger of Prince Rama.&nbsp;</p><p>Lord Rama states, “Jab Sita mile toh usse kehna, milan ki vyakulta se mein bhi utna hi ghira hun. Jis prakaar Sita ke netra viyog ke ashru nahi tham rahe honge, usi prakaar Ram ke netron ka bandh bhi nahi ruk raha hai. Use kehna uska pata chalte hi mein shran bhar ka bhi vilambh nahi karunga aur sighra adhi sighra, uska Ram use lene awashya aayega. (When you meet Sita, do tell her that I am also impatient to unite with her. Just like Sita must not be able to stop shedding tears of separation, Ram’s flood of tears is also not taking any pause. Tell her that after finding her location, I will not wait even for a moment. Her Ram will definitely come to take her at the earliest).” <a rel=nofollow href=# class="looms--artdiv loomsart--logodiv loomsart--logodiv-v2" onclick='trigger17LoomsEntryClick("17Looms_AP_Logo","-","-","-")'><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.pinkvilla.com/assets/images/17looms_pinkvilla_deshtop_article_entry_updated.jpg alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><span class=f14>Advertisement</span><p>As Ram shows his full faith in Hanuman for procuring evidence of Sita Maa’s abduction to Lanka, the Monkey God also exhibits unwavering dedication in completing his mission and proving that even the most difficult trials in life can be overcome with determination.
