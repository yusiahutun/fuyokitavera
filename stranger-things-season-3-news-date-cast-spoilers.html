To wait out the home stretch, BAZAAR.com is gathering everything we know about what's to come in the new season, including details about new characters and locations, returning fan favorites, and why the stakes are greater than ever Eleven, Mike, and company.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">First, check out the trailers for the upcoming season, then read on for more about Mayor Kline, Starcourt Mall, and much more.</p><h2 data-node-id=7 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">1) Season 3 returns to Netflix Thursday, July 4.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">There was a 615-day gap between Seasons 2 and 3, but new episodes of Stranger Things drop July 4, 2019 on Netflix. There will only be eight episodes this time around (Season 2 had a total of nine), and here's how Netflix is describing the new season:</p>It’s 1985 in Hawkins, Indiana, and summer's heating up. School’s out, there’s a brand-new mall in town, and the Hawkins crew are on the cusp of adulthood. Romance blossoms and complicates the group’s dynamic, and they’ll have to figure out how to grow up without growing apart. Meanwhile, danger looms. When the town’s threatened by enemies old and new, Eleven and her friends are reminded that evil never ends; it evolves. Now they’ll have to band together to survive, and remember that friendship is always stronger than fear.<br><h2 data-node-id=12 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">2) Season 3 is "darker but funnier."</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Gaten Matarazzo <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.bbc.com/news/av/entertainment-arts-46400385/stranger-things-star-season-three-will-be-darker-but-funnier data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="revealed to the BBC" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">revealed to the BBC</a> in December 2018 that filming Season 3 felt different due to the story's "intensity." He added, "It's darker but it's funnier, and there's just a lot going on." This tracks with what Stranger Things co-creator Matt Duffer told <a href=# data-href=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/stranger-things-season-2-ending-explained-duffer-brothers-finale-interview-1052168 data-external=true data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/stranger-things-season-2-ending-explained-duffer-brothers-finale-interview-1052168 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="The Hollywood Reporter" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">The Hollywood Reporter</a> right after Season 2 premiered, pointing to the need for a "clean slate" for the new season: "We didn't want to box ourselves in for Season 3."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">During an appearance on Good Morning America, Matarazzo added that Season 3 is "gorier" and "not for the faint of heart." Watch the full interview below.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">As a reminder, Season 2 did not end on an obvious cliffhanger; instead the Hawkins gang received a surprise happy ending at the school's Snow Ball dance—minus that ominous final shot of the <a href=# data-href=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/film-tv/a13104406/shadow-monster-stranger-things-season-2/ data-external=true data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/film-tv/a13104406/shadow-monster-stranger-things-season-2/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Mind Flayer" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Mind Flayer</a> hovering over a version of the school inside the Upside Down.<br></p><h2 data-node-id=18 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">3) Some sort of monster is locked in Hawkins—and it wants Billy.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">P<strong></strong>lot details remain top-secret, but the final trailer offers a solid glimpse at what's to come in the new season. Namely, a monster from the Upside Down is stuck in Hawkins. The eerie voiceover says it all: "You let us in. And now, you are going to have to let us stay. We're going to end you. We are going to end your friends. Then we're going to end everyone." (Doesn't the voice sound a bit like Hopper?)</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Eleven is confused, of course, since she closed the gate to the Upside Down in the Season 2 finale. But as Will points out, "What if he [the Mind Flayer] never left? What if we locked him out here with us? He'd want to attach himself to someone again. A new host." The trailer all but confirms that this new host is Hawkins' resident bully and hunky lifeguard, Billy Hargrove.</p><img alt="Face, Light, Darkness, Human, Movie, Photography, Screenshot, Flash photography, Electric blue, Fictional character, " title="Face, Light, Darkness, Human, Movie, Photography, Screenshot, Flash photography, Electric blue, Fictional character, " width=2880 height=1416 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/screen-shot-2019-06-21-at-10-11-16-am-1561126348.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Netflix</span><p>Dacre Montgomery as Billy Hargrove in the Stranger Things 3 final trailer.</p><h2 data-node-id=26 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">4) The new poster offers hints at the Season 3 plot.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Netflix released new promotional imagery one month ahead of the Season 3 premiere. The visuals show Eleven in her signature pose (holding up her hand with a bloody nose), along with the rest of the gang and that terrifying, still-unnamed monster. We also see dead rats lining the floor (an omen of sorts?), the Starcourt Mall in a point of prominence, a mysterious Fun Fair, and Billy in what looks like the Upside Down.</p><img alt="Poster, Movie, Album cover, Advertising, Graphic design, Flyer, Games, Illustration, " title="Poster, Movie, Album cover, Advertising, Graphic design, Flyer, Games, Illustration, " width=1500 height=2222 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/strangerthings-s3-illustrated-vertical-final-rgb-digital-en-1559683386.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Netflix</span><p>Netflix has released a new poster for Stranger Things Season 3, which will premiere on July 4.</p><h2 data-node-id=30 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">5) Season 3 will take place one year after Season 2 and reference major movies of the '80s and '90s.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=31 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Executive producer Shawn Levy <a href=# data-external=true data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/stranger-things-first-season-3-details-revealed-1097178 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="told The Hollywood Reporter" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">told The Hollywood Reporter</a> in March 2018 that Season 3 of the new series would take place in the summer of 1985, a little less than a year after the events of Season 2. It was a big summer for movies: The Goonies premiered June 7, while Back to the Future followed on July 3. Levy promised the latter would be a big reference point for Season 3.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=32 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Additionally, the Duffer Brothers <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://ew.com/tv/2019/05/23/stranger-things-3-movies-that-inspired-new-season/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="told Entertainment Weekly" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">told Entertainment Weekly</a> that six specific movies and one very famous filmmaker influenced Season 3, which they call "our most unapologetically fun season" and "our most horrifying and intense season." The movies include Fast Times at Ridgemont High, Indiana Jones, and Jurassic Park, and the filmmaker in question is the king of body horror, David Cronenberg.</p><h2 data-node-id=35 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">5) The episode titles are puzzling.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=36 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In a teaser for the upcoming season, Netflix announced the titles of all eight episodes of Season 3.</p><li>"Suzie, Do You Copy?"</li><li>"The Mall Rats"</li><li>"The Case of the Missing Lifeguard"</li><li>"The Sauna Test"</li><li>"The Source"</li><li>"The Birthday"</li><li>"The Bite"</li><li>"The Battle of Starcourt"</li><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=39 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The first and most obvious question is, who is Suzie? Susan Hargrove is Max's mom and Billy's stepmom, but that doesn't necessarily mean she's the Suzie in question.<br></p><h2 data-node-id=41 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">6) Hawkins is getting a new mall.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=42 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">A teaser released in July 2018 <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/film-tv/a22163480/stranger-things-season-3-teaser-trailer-starcourt-mall/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="showcases the new Starcourt Mall" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">showcases the new Starcourt Mall</a> coming to Hawkins, Indiana. The clip doesn’t reveal much about the plot of the next season, but it does show Steve (Joe Keery) and Robin (new cast member Maya Hawke) as employees at Scoops Ahoy Ice Cream Parlor. (Note their adorably cheesy uniforms.)</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=43 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Star Millie Bobby Brown shared photos from set to mark the end of shooting Season 3 in early November, and one showed her hanging out on the Starcourt Mall set with Noah Schnapp, who plays Will.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=45 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Considering the eighth episode of Season 3 is called “The Battle of Starcourt,” does that mean a big, final showdown will take place at the new mall?</p><h2 data-node-id=47 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">6) Eleven and Mike are now a couple, and so are Max and Lucas.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=48 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">This seemed inevitable after the Season 2 finale, which saw both duos share quick kisses.

He's also looking forward to exploring Hopper's relationship with Eleven now that he's officially, legally her father.
