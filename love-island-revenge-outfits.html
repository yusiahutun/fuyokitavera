Love Island UK is known for having the messiest breakups both on and off screen, and the newest spinoff Love Island All Stars is no exception. While winners Molly Smith and Tom Clare are still together—Georgia Steel and Toby Aromolaran, Jess Gale and Callum Jones, and Georgia Harrison and Anton Danyluk, have all called it quits since the show’s conclusion.</p><p>If you’re following the cast on social media, you know that when <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Pretty Little Thing</a> hosts an event, most of the islanders will be in attendance—which makes for some messy running-into-your-ex situations. Anyone that’s been through a breakup knows that you need to look your absolute best when seeing your ex again. For Georgia S and Jess, Pretty Little Thing’s 1st Birthday was the place to make their exes eat their hearts out. (Georgia H wasn’t in attendance but we have no doubt she would’ve pulled out her best outfit too.)</p><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>While most of the islanders <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">have messy relationships with their cast mates</a> both romantically and platonically (Georgia Steel has made it clear she’s not close with any of them), the stakes were very high at the Pretty Little Thing party. Think of it as the Met Gala of the Love Island franchise. And while we’re all judging their outfits from home—we know deep down that they’re doing the same exact thing to each other.</p><ul class="pmc-fallback-list-items lrv-a-unstyle-list lrv-u-margin-t-2"><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1.5><h2>Georgia Steel</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-2148326470.jpg><p>Georgia Steel stepped out in an unconventional revenge outfit for the Pretty Little Thing party. While her ex Toby wasn’t in attendance, she definitely dressed up knowing he would see photos from the night. For her revenge look, she wore a black denim button up shirt and matching pants with black pointed heels. Regardless of your opinions of Georgia, you have to admit she’s always looking her best. Although this is less showy than her usual outfits, she still looks very chic.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=0><h2>Jess Harding</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-2148326660.jpg><p>After a recent breakup with Callum, Jess arrived to the PLT party wearing a cropped pale pink corset and an animal print mini skirt. Callum also attended the party, so luckily Jess had her twin sister Eve with her to take on the night.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=0><h2>Anton Danyluk</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-2148326616.jpg><p>Anton also dressed to the nines for the Pretty Little Thing party. Him and Georgia Harrison recently split, so this is his own version of a revenge outfit. While he’s much more dressed up than the other male islanders, we can’t help but applaud him for looking so put together.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=0><h2>Arabella Chi</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-2148325386.jpg><p>Although Arabella Chi and Adam Maxted haven’t been together since the show ended, we still consider this to be her revenge fit. Her khaki blazer and slouchy boots compliment each other perfectly. Who knows, this cute ‘fit might lead to a new romance.</p></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57y6Kqratfoby3sYyiqqWZnpl6s7HVnqWgnV2kwrWyyK2qaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
