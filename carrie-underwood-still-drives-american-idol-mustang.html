She rose through the ranks of the show and went on to win it, and she's had a huge career that spans nearly two decades and is far from over.</p><p>One of the prizes Underwood got from winning American Idol was a brand-new Ford Mustang convertible. That car is now 18 years-old, and she not only still has it, she will still occasionally drive it.</p><p>“I do still have the car that I won when I won American Idol,” Underwood reveals during an interview with <a href=#>Today's Country Radio With Kelleigh Bannen</a> on Apple Music. “So I have my blue Mustang. And every once in a while something will happen where I’ll have my car getting serviced or whatever, and I’ll get to drive that car. And it always makes me want to drive it more, because it was such a pivotal point in my life. That was the car that I was driving around when I first moved to Tennessee, and I’m very, very glad I still have that car.</p><p>"Every time I get in it, I’m always like, ‘Why don’t I just drive this more often?'” she adds. “Just because, it makes me feel good.”</p><p>Underwood wraps her Denim and Rhinestones Tour with <a href=#>Jimmie Allen</a> on Friday (March 17). She will kick off the <a href=#>2023 dates of her Las Vegas residency</a> in June.</p><p>Underwood also released a new song called "Out of That Truck" on her 40th birthday on March 10, which will most likely appear on her next album.</p><h2 class=photogallery-title>PICTURES: See Inside Carrie Underwood's Breathtaking Nashville Mansion</h2><p>Carrie Underwood and her husband, Mike Fisher, owned a 4-bedroom, 4-bathroom, 2-half-bathroom home in an affluent Nashville suburb called Brentwood. The 7,000-square-foot mansion features a wet bar, fitness center and tennis court, as well as a four-car garage, walk-out basement with heated marble floors and extra appliances, including a sub-zero fridge and wine fridge. That house is where Underwood suffered a devastating fall in 2017.</p><p>The couple sold the luxurious home for $1,410,000 in March of 2019, after they moved into the massive dream home that they had spent several years building from scratch.</p><h2 class=photogallery-title>PICTURES: Look Inside Carrie Underwood + Mike Fisher's Spectacular Ottawa Mansion</h2><p>Carrie Underwood and Mike Fisher built a spectacular rural estate in Ottawa when they first married, and pictures show a property that is luxurious, but also rustic.</p><h2 class=photogallery-title>PICTURES: See Inside Carrie Underwood's Beautiful Post-'American Idol' Home</h2><p>Carrie Underwood invested her money wisely after winning American Idol in 2005. One of her first big purchases was a 3,099-square-foot home in the well-to-do Nashville suburb of Franklin, Tenn. Underwood paid $384,000 for a luxurious 3-bedroom, 3.5-bathroom stone and stucco home in a private gated community.</p><p>The house features a library, a vaulted ceiling and lovely amenities throughout, but while it's very nice, it's certainly not the kind of home you'd picture for a budding country superstar. Underwood wound up being a huge success right out of the gate with her debut album, Some Hearts, and she sold the home in Franklin for $372,500 in 2007, when she purchased the Brentwood mansion that she would later share with her husband, Mike Fisher.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmnJmip7amedSnm56qp6S8pXnSraClpF2Zv6rCxKxkmqWVp7akrc1moJ2nnGK6tr%2FTmqWgZw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
