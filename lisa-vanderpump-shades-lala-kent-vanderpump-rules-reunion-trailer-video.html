In the recently released clip from Bravo,&nbsp;<strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Lala Kent</a>&nbsp;</strong>can be seen tearing up over her ex&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Randall Emmett</strong></a>‘s alleged infidelity and <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Lisa Vanderpump</strong></a> didn’t hold back with her response to the scandal.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>“Randall Emmett creeping around on me — that should have been brought to my attention,” Lala states in the trailer. “The fact that this man — he made me feel safe enough to bring a child into this world. I feel disgusted.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>While Lala’s co-star <strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>James Kennedy</a>&nbsp;</strong>admitted he heard “sexual rumors” and&nbsp;<strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Scheana Shay</a>&nbsp;</strong>mocked her for calling Randall a “stand-up man” compared to <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>her own fiancé</a> (who Lala had tension with this season), <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Brock Davies</strong></a>, VPR matriarch Lisa gave her two cents about the messy split between the couple who share 10-month-old daughter <strong>Ocean</strong>. “Sometimes the way you get them is the way you lose them,” the 61-year-old restaurateur scoffed.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Vanderpump Rules&nbsp;fans were initially introduced to Lala’s man during season 5 of the show, although his identity was kept tightly under wraps at the time until the pair went public with their relationship in 2018. Randall was previously married to actress <strong>Amber Childers&nbsp;</strong>from 2009 to 2017 and he proposed to Lala one year after his divorce was finalized.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>The pair postponed their wedding plans due to the coronavirus pandemic and <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>rumors began to swirl</a> in fall 2021 of Randall’s alleged infidelity when Lala seemed to have erased all evidence of her fiancé from social media. Their <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>split was confirmed</a> shortly thereafter as a source <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>EXCLUSIVELY revealed</a> to&nbsp;<strong>HollywoodLife&nbsp;</strong>that “the rug was pulled out from under her completely,” leaving everyone around the beauty mogul “shocked” by the news. “She thought he loved her. She will never go back to him again. She’s done for good and never have another discussion about it. It’s a wrap.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/lisa-vanderpump-lala-kent-vanderpump-rules-reunion-bravo-post11.jpg><p>In Dec. 2021, Lala also disclosed on the Not Skinny But Not Fat&nbsp;podcast that she wished someone would have “voiced any concern” for her with regard to the relationship with the film producer. “James and [<strong>Tom</strong>] <strong>Sandoval</strong> both expressed that they knew things. As time passes, I have a lot of people that are telling me things,” she explained. “Everyone wants to say, ‘It’s not your business.’ How would you feel? I would give everything to turn back the clock and have someone tell me something.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpiZH1ye5BxZqWho5Z6t63NnZyrqKWivW6%2Fx5qbnqtdoa6trYyknKesXauur7DEq6eupaBiv7a4xKxkq52lo7awuoytqZqhnJq%2FbsLInZyoZw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
