Right now, the six shows listed below are his only six shows listed for 2023.</p><figure class="img-tag has-sizer aligncenter" readability=2><p>attachment-George Strait Stadium Poster</p><p>loading...</p></figure><p>Both Little Big Town and Stapleton opened the Minneapolis show, and in a press release, the Strait and Stapleton shared admiration for one another. When the 70-year-old announced his plans to retire from the road in 2012, he left open the possibility for something like this. At the time he made it clear that the touring life was not for him any longer, but he still very much liked performing.</p><p>The first stop is scheduled for May 6 in Glendale, Ariz. Strait will then play three shows in June, one in late July and another in early August. Tickets for all shows go on sale on Nov. 4 at 10AM local time.</p><h3>George Strait's 2023 Stadium Tour Dates:</h3><p>May 6 — Glendale, Ariz. @ State Farm Stadium<br>June 3 — Milwaukee, Wisc. @ American Family Field<br>June 17 — Seattle Wash. @ Lumen Field<br>June 24 — Denver Colo. @ Empower Field at Mile High Stadium<br>July 28 — Nashville, Tenn. @ Nissan Stadium<br>July 29 — Nashville, Tenn. @ Nissan Stadium<br>Aug. 5 — Tampa, Fla. @ Raymond James Stadium</p><h2 class=photogallery-title>PICTURES: Look Inside George Strait's Spectacular Mansion</h2><p>George Strait is selling his one-of-a-kind mansion in Texas, and he's actually reduced his price considerably.

The main house is wired for surround sound throughout, and it also features outdoor living spaces including a patio with built-in grill, sink, icemaker and refrigerator.
