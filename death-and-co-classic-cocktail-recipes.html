There are some fantastic books on technique, cocktail history, spirit production, and books of recipes but not so many, or any that I saw, that give you the look and feel of being in a cocktail bar. Cookbooks often do a great job of this, such as A Day at El Bulli or Peter Meehan's Momofuku book. They give you a look and feel in to the life of the restaurant, on both sides, from a guest's experience and what it is to run the restaurant. I wanted to accomplish the same. We also set out to speak about what it is to really create cocktails, and hopefully empower the reader to do so for themselves, or at least be able to reinterpret our recipes for what they have in their home bar, or get inspiration for their own cocktails.</p><h2 data-node-id=6 class="css-p3fpzg emevuu60">HB: To what do you attribute the rise in artisanal cocktails?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>DK:</strong> The rise in cocktails is directly related to the rise in great food. If a town has an exceptional restaurant scene a good cocktail scene is sure to follow. I think this has to do with guests general awareness of what they're consuming, the want for a story behind every ingredient, the longing for some connection to what they're eating or drinking. Media has also played a strong part as cocktail culture has grown, media has pushed it in to a great snowball effect. You now see classic cocktails of every sort of show or media platform, cocktails have very much hit the mainstream. I had a conversation with a friend, actually a bartender, years ago and he asked when I thought cocktails would pass as a fade. I answered that eating well has never gone out of fashion, and drinking well, now that we understand what that is again, will never go out of fashion either.</p><h2 data-node-id=10 class="css-p3fpzg emevuu60">HB: What's the secret to a great cocktail?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>DK:</strong> Great ingredients, balanced recipe, and skillful technique. Cocktails can be incredibly easy or absurdly complex to execute, but the end result should always seem equally effortless.</p><h2 data-node-id=15 class="css-p3fpzg emevuu60">HB: Favorite ingredient?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>DK:</strong> Vermouth. I typically gravitate towards stirred drinks of various base spirits with bianco or blanc vermouth, or dry vermouth.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>Conference</strong></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Created by: Brian Miller, 2008</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">One of our servers asked me to make her something stirred and boozy. So I threw four of my favorite spirits into an old-fashioned template, splitting the base four ways. These brown spirits needed something to tie them together.
