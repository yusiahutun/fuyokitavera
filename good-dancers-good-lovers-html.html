"They are so proud of their moves that they'll spend more time in bed making sure they look good rather than trying to please their partner," said Ms Everett.</p><p>But men who are shy on the dance floor are just as shy in bed according to 62 per cent.</p><p>"Beware the bloke that does the side-to-side shuffle on the dance floor. Boring, unimaginative and uninspiring, he'll generate even less energy in bed," Ms Everett added.</p><p>The study also reveals that frantic and furious "action men" who are all arms and legs on the dance floor will have plenty of energy but little imagination in bed, while those men who only dance with their mates are to be avoided - they're only likely to be interested in beer and football.</p><p>But it's good news for those who are "relaxed and rhythmic" on the dance floor. The study reveals that these dancers always look like they've got something in reserve, and they usually have.</p><p>"They'll be creative, caring, considerate, skilful and full of surprises when it comes to sex," concludes Ms Everett.</p><p>The women, aged between 18 and 40, were questioned on the streets of Glasgow, Manchester, Cardiff, Birmingham and London.</p><p>The survey was carried out by Phones 4U's to coincide launch of their latest advert, which features a man on an amusement arcade dance machine.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCmmZmhe6S7ja6iaJ6Voq6quI6aqa2hk6Gybn2Wcmhral98vLCwjJ2Yp5uVp8Buecaopp1lnKTDpr7SZ5%2BtpZw%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
