Decades have passed, and Aniston has remained my hairspo (hair inspiration for those not in tune with the vernacular) throughout all of the cuts and colors that she’s donned, so when she casually unveiled one of the tools that she uses to quaff her locks, I took immediate note.</p><p>It all went down on the Emmy winner’s Instagram, where she posted a tutorial showing off one of the products from her haircare brand, <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Lolavie</a>. See, after she applied the Glossing Detangler to her wet locks, she <a href=#>tamed them with a brush</a> that you can find with a 38 percent <a href=#>Prime Day</a> discount. That brings the Coral Ombre version’s price down from $15 to under $10. Other colorways are marked down, too, but this one is the best deal of the bunch. Just be sure to <a href=#>sign up for a Prime membership</a> to snag this deal and so many others during <a href=# id=auto-tag_prime-day data-tag=prime-day>Prime Day</a>.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Outlander.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Outlander.jpg><p>The <a href=# id=auto-tag_wet-brush data-tag=wet-brush>Wet Brush</a> is not your average comb. It’s <a href=#>made with special bristles that flex as they encounter any tangles in your hair</a>, so that your locks aren’t yanked or broken. Designed to contour to your head’s round shape for comfortable brushing, the haircare essential is a fan favorite among those who struggle with hair loss. Shoppers say that compared to most other hair detanglers, this one “hurts less and causes less&nbsp;<span class=reviews-highlight>breakage</span>.”</p><p>Though the clip Aniston posted is quick, you can see just how easily the brush runs through her locks. Her hair doesn’t get caught on any bristles, and the product runs through her hair like a hand in water—smoothly and gracefully. That’s the kind of experience we all deserve when we just wake up, or finish up a relaxing shower.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/71jhCGrD-L._SL1500_.jpg><h2 class="_text_y7yck_1 _text_153t8_1" data-component=text data-alias data-alignment data-theme=product-title-lg data-transform data-truncate>Wet Brush Brush Pro Flex Dry</h2><p><span class="_text_y7yck_1 _text_153t8_1" data-component=text data-alias data-alignment data-theme=product-price data-transform data-truncate>$9.35 (was $15)</span></p><p>There’s nothing more dreadful than getting out of the shower only to know that you have to spend 10 minutes combing through your hair and experiencing tug after tug.
