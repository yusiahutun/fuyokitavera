I loved Tristan with all my heart. I know we shouldn't have snuck around but I also know she's 14 and I am 19 but that did not matter to us. We cared about each other deeply. It was her birthday soon and we just wanted to see each other. When I got to her house everything was fine for a few hours but then we heard someone come in. We thought it was her parents, but it was some man. He looked to be in his mid 50's, wore blue jeans and a Boston Red Sox ball cap. Thinking it was her parents, I hid in the bathroom, but I realized it wasn't her parents when Tristan started screaming. I didn't see what happened, but I believe she was (assaulted) because she kept screaming for him to get off her and I just stood by. I wanted to try and help her, but he was threatening her with a gun. I knew if I tried anything he would shoot me too but if I knew now what I knew after it all happened I would gave my life to try and save her.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span class=mol-style-bold>Now this is all happened I feel it will just be better to end my life. I can't live knowing I was too much of a coward to do anything about it. I don't even know Tristan's parents' names, but I am so sorry this happened. I'd do anything to go back and stop him if I could. Mom, I love you with all my heart, you were the best mom anyone could ask for. I wish I could've finished college and got a job with good family but now things will never be the same. I feel they will hold me responsible and after watching so many shows of Lock-Up, I'd rather die than be locked up in a cage my whole life. I have so many questions as well. Why did this happen to us? But I guess the universe if full of surprises. Yes, I am scared to die but the alternative to staying alive seems hopeless. I just hope my death is quick.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span class=mol-style-bold>I believe Tristan died instantly. I just remember hearing two shots and then silence. When I looked in her room, all I could see was a perfectly still body and a huge puddle of blood. I didn't know what to do besides run but even running from something like this is useless. My only wish is to be cremated and I want all of my possessions to go to my parents. I know people will think that I killed her or I was responsible for letting it happen but I know what happened. I felt like a drop of water in all the oceans. I wanted to scream but no words could come out. It was as if the breath was knocked out of me.'</span>&nbsp;</p>&lt;!- - ad: https://mads.dailymail.co.uk/v8/us/news/none/article/other/mpu_factbox.html?id=mpu_factbox_1 - -><span class=mol-ads-label-container><span class=mol-ads-label>Advertisement</span></span><p class=mol-para-with-font>Thinking it was Dilley's parents, Adams said he hid in the bathroom, but he realized something was amiss when he heard the 14-year-old girl screaming.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>He went on to say that while he did not witness what happened, he believed Tristan was assaulted 'because she kept screaming for him to get off her and I just stood by,' he said.
