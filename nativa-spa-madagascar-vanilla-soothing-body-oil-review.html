To keep the momentum going, I decided to branch out and try the brand’s <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://go.linkby.com/DFDBRCNP rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Madagascar Vanilla Soothing Body Oil</a>, and yes, it ended up being as enticing as it sounds.</p><p>Nativa SPA infuses pure quinoa oil into nearly all of its products because of the ingredient’s high content of protein, fiber and healthy fats; it instantly adds moisture back into the skin while firming and smoothing areas of concern. Best of all, users will notice results as fast as a month from implementing pure quinoa oil into their regimen daily.&nbsp;</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/kentucky-derby-2.jpeg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/buffing-bar.jpg><p>The <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://go.linkby.com/DFDBRCNP rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">body oil</a> contains this precious ingredient, alongside sustainably sourced Madagascar Vanilla, the star of this product’s formula, in my humble opinion. The brand describes the oil’s unique vanilla scent as a “cozy, warm, sweet aroma combined with a surprising touch of lemon.” I’d describe it as pure bliss—no joke. If you’re a fan of sugary, sweet fragrances, this will be right up your alley.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/nativa-spa-vanilla-oil.jpg><p>Not only does it instantly engulf your skin with the irresistible scent, but it also lingers for hours after the fact. I’ll use it right in the morning, and by the evening, I’m happy to find my skin has retained the scent as strongly as when it was first applied. It’s almost like a subtle perfume and skincare in one.</p><p><strong><a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://stylecaster.com/beauty/skin-care/1743847/pmd-renew-hydratingpeptides-serum/ rel="noreferrer noopener">RELATED: This Serum Contains Gold & Silver to Ward Off Aging—& Reviewers Say It Works In Just 3 Weeks</a></strong></p><p>The way it makes my skin feel is also of importance; this isn’t your greasy, takes an hour to sink in type of <a href=# id=auto-tag_body-oil data-tag=body-oil>body oil</a>—A.K.A. the one’s that have fed into my laziness in the past. It quite literally melts into your skin upon contact and doesn’t leave you feeling like a sticky pot of honey. The instant softness it adds to your body is also crazy good, and especially soothes the skin post-shaving.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Madagascar Vanilla Soothing Body Oil</a> has more fans than just me. Reviewers on the brand’s website have called it “pure wonder in a bottle” and described it as smelling “like heaven.” One person said “a little really goes a long way to make my skin glow,” while another called it a “great smelling oil” with a scent that “lasts all day.”</p><p>Truthfully, this body oil would make for a great addition to any summer skincare routine since it absorbs quickly and never feels heavy. Plus, you’ll be in for a ton of compliments on its scent from others.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57wZ6YrqypZMCstc1mmpqqlWR%2BeICTaW5vZ56WwarCwGaqqZldoq6lrcaaqpyZomLDorrIpaOaZaOkvLW0yKeeZpqfmcZuu8ilZKudpp6yuHs%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
