What does their happily ever after look like? Are they just in a perpetual state of bliss? Do they have an everlasting passion for one another, and are all their biggest issues behind them?</p>The answer is no. Every relationship requires work, especially long-term relationships. Maybe you have overcome the hurdle of making the first move, treading unfamiliar territories, <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">compromising and getting to know each another</span></a>, but with time, new hurdles emerge.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Here is a common one: keeping the relationship interesting and fun for years. So, how can we keep the fun alive in a long-term relationship? I have four suggestions.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/09/23/7e9745d9-1ead-4d29-8f85-655e31581f8b_e41957fe.jpg><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1">Stay curious</h3>One of the biggest relationship killers is assuming we know our partner so well, <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">we stop paying attention</span></a>. We assume we know everything there is to know, so we stop listening.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The reality is that people grow and change, and to make the relationship work we need to keep up with each other. Maybe you knew what their favourite hobby, sex position or foods were when they were in university, but have you checked in lately?</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The relationship needs to be a safe space where each person can explore and be curious about who they are, and have their partner be part of that journey. A sense of unfounded familiarity cannot only lead us to think we are still dating a version of our partner from a year ago, but it can lead to boredom and complacency.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/09/23/5f72801c-f833-4468-920c-85722df9549a_49cd0852.jpg><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1">Try new things</h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">A great way to keep things interesting is by staying curious about who we are and who they are.</p>It is easy to get into a rut and go to your three favourite restaurants, <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">do one hobby together</span></a>, have a go-to sex routine and hang out with the same people. And although there is nothing wrong with that, to keep things interesting it can be helpful to try new things.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">I once heard of a couple who asked each other to learn a new skill. She asked him to take cooking classes (so he can help out with meal prep and they can try out some new recipes at home), and he asked her to take some massage classes (so that she can help him with his tension headaches). How cool!</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Some couples will randomly flip through The Kama Sutra book and try a new sex position once a month or go to an event and be intentional about meeting at least one new person. There is no right or wrong way of doing this – figure out what works for you as a couple.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/09/23/e36e48c7-42be-4b47-941c-058c421104a2_24011521.jpg><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1">Surprise each other</h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">I am not talking about jumping out of the bushes, more like thoughtful gestures of love. Yes, it is fun to be spontaneous, but sometimes you have to plan your spontaneity.</p>Show the person you still care, that you were listening to them when they spoke about <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">their dream hiking spot</span></a> or their favourite food of the moment. You can surprise them with a clean house, a cute sticky note or a weekend picnic. Surprises are not just about the size of the action, but about the thoughtfulness behind it.<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/09/23/a02cdee6-e118-431a-a7e6-7916c06d3a6b_89bc71d9.jpg><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1">Be flirty</h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Yes, yes, you won them over and now you are in a relationship. But, this does not mean that sexual tension and witty banter need to exit the stage. On the contrary, it becomes really important in keeping the desire and connection alive. Sending a flirty text or giving them a wink during a family dinner can sometimes do the trick.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Sara Kuburic is a therapist who specialises in identity, relationships and moral trauma.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuaqyxKyrsqSVZLOiucilsGaqlaGutbXOp6qhoaCofKK%2B06KapZ1faH56f5Ruamixn6q%2FbrjOp55mrJWnum6%2BxKWYraGfo8Cptc9mmaiqmaO0boCMraCpq12gsqa8</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
