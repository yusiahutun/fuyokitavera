The landscape was bought by her late husband in 1990 for £10.8m.Tita, 69, told newspaper that the decision to sell was "painful", but the current economic crisis made it impossible to keep the piece. "I have no liquidity. Keeping the collection here is costly to me, and I get nothing in return."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/d1db9042ee47-tita-cervera-z.jpg><p id=eiZ9qdrqX2eD data-wc=208>Her husband the Baron was a Swiss industrialist, who amassed a 250-strong collecton of artwork, which he loaned to Spain where he made his home for several decades.Baroness Thyssen has been a regular in the society pages since before the couple married in 1985. He adopted&nbsp;her son Borja and she also has twin daughters, Guadalupe Sabina and María del Carmen, born to a surrogate in 2006. When the baron&nbsp;died in 2002, he left Tita, his fifth wife,&nbsp;the priceless&nbsp;collection – a decision which was not entirely well received by the four other children of his previous marriages.The baroness' stepdaughter Francesca told : "The baroness has shown absolutely no respect for my father and is simply putting her own financial needs above everything else." Their relationship has had its difficulties, with the socialite recently telling a Spanish news agency: "One day she loves you a lot. The next day she doesn't know you. That's how (Francesca) is. "But others agree with Francesca. One of the trustees of the Thyssen-Bornemisza museum&nbsp;resigned in protest.In a letter explaining his decision, Sir Norman Rosenthal, wrote that the&nbsp;sale "represents a moral shame on the part of all those concerned, most especially on the part of Tita."</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
