However, it was her accessories that had her fans racing to comment.&nbsp;</p><p id=eap0qVwT_b data-wc=18>"And where is Larsa? 'Cause that's not her," replied one. A second said: "Girl, that is not you."&nbsp;</p><a href=# style=text-decoration:none rel="noopener noreferrer">View post on Instagram</a>&nbsp;<p id=endoXmgldS data-wc=17>A third added: "Who is this?"
