Following the series 19 finale – which aired on Thursday evening – fans have been wondering which of their favorite characters will be returning, and we have the answer.&nbsp;</p><figure class=videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff>WATCH: Grey's Anatomy season 19 finale trailer</figure><p id=eq6F9F3IK2F data-wc=52>According to <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Deadline</a>, several of the show's original cast members will be back for season 20. Following the renewal of Grey's, deals have wrapped up quickly, and it has now been confirmed that the longest-serving members – James Pickens Jr. and Chandra Wilson – will return as Richard Webber and Miranda Bailey.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/5c7baff692d0-chandra-wilson-as-miranda-bailey.jpg><p id=ehbOIzJ0ol data-wc=18><strong>MORE:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Station 19 fans spot 'sneaky' Carina and Maya detail in latest episode - did you notice it?</a></p><p id=eadMDWrFrf8 data-wc=8><strong data-gid=eW46L6vUJ2k>READ:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Why did Justin Chambers leave Grey's Anatomy?</a></p><p id=eXriyx_mf69 data-wc=40>Meanwhile, Kevin McKidd, who joined the medical drama in season five, will reprise his role as Owen Hunt. Kim Raver (Teddy Altman), Camilla Luddington (Jo Wilson) and Caterina Scorsone (Amelia Shephard) are also on the cast list for season 20.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/d5b466362b3d-richard-greys-anatomy.jpg><p id=e67lxV8pgck data-wc=53>As for <a class=hm-link href=#>Ellen Pompeo</a>, the star may have departed in series 19, but that doesn't mean she won't appear in the 20th instalment, especially as it's a landmark season. While the actress departed in February 2023, she remains an executive producer on Grey's and provides the voiceover that opens and closes each episode.</p><p id=eWFU6xQ_0yD data-wc=42>Ellen was also a key part of the series 19 finale. As Dr Winston Ndugu, Nick Marsh, Amelia Shepherd, Miranda Bailey, Richard Webber and his wife travelled to Boston for the Catherine Fox Awards, they were reunited with our girl, Meredith Grey.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/28f8e2708940-ellen-pompeo-as-meredith-grey.jpg><p id=eYnjWh6hcDK data-wc=36>During the two-hour event, Meredith was seen presenting the Catherine Fox Award to her good friend and former colleague, Miranda. Later in the episode, we were also treated to a romantic scene between Meredith and Nick.&nbsp;</p><p id=esKt4pEuJRG data-wc=57>As Meredith tried to deliver a letter to Nick's hotel room, he quickly stopped her in the hallway. After confessing their feelings to one another, the pair then shared a kiss. Based on this moment alone, we're hoping that Ellen will appear in season 20 – we need to know what happens next with Meredith and Nick!&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/landscape/5f960abfd2ee-kelly-mcreary-as-maggie-greys-anatomy.jpg><p id=e3VhTfi-4f5 data-wc=37>On a bittersweet note, however, Kelly McCreary, who plays Maggie Price, will not be returning for season 20. Prior to the season 19 finale, the actress announced that she had decided to leave Grey's Anatomy in March.</p><p id=ecJvjQjtoXs data-wc=115>Taking to Instagram, Kelly shared a photo of her beloved character, alongside the caption: "9 seasons, 200 episodes, scores of heroic surgeries, countless brave patients, dozens of delightful sister house scenes, 1 episode with my real-life sister, some loss and some grief, a few ghostly visitations from mothers, a handful of boyfriends, 2 gorgeous weddings, a bunch of drunken emotional breakdowns, 1 high-speed chase, several awkward dinner parties, 1 punch taken (1 punch thrown), at least 1 pratfall, buckets of tears, innumerable fits of laughter, all the medical jargon mastered, a slew of friends for life, myriad collaborators who grew me as an artist, 1 grateful heart and 1 massive THANK YOU.
