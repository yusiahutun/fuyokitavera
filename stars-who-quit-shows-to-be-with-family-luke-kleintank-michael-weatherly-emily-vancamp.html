Addressing her 2022 exit from spin-off, , she said: "While I have been so beyond fortunate to have this career and a job that I love, with not an iota of regret, for some time I have suppressed a gravitational pull to return home to Australia to be closer to my nearest and dearest.</p><p dir=ltr>"The past two years have been trying, for everyone. I fully recognize the privilege of being able to work and make our show during a global pandemic, but it also meant being separated from my loved ones when we needed each other the most.

"I spent so many years on network television, but then suddenly priorities shifted. I think there comes a moment in every woman's life—in every person's life—where it becomes less about work and more about family, and that's what happened while I was making the show.&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr>"Doing that many episodes in a different city and then you add Covid to that, most of us couldn't see our families for almost a year.
