Today, as with all purchases, being environmentally-conscious about what we’re buying is a priority. A wedding dress, you could argue, is one of the most unsustainable purchases you can make. You spend a lot of money on an intricately made gown to wear it only once - after which point it remains in a darkened corner of your wardrobe.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">With this and the planet's future in mind, there are some ways you can find ‘the one’ in a smarter, more sustainable way. There's a clear appetite for a new approach; the search term "low-waste wedding" was up by 235 per cent on <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://newsroom.pinterest.com/en/post/pinterest-100-the-top-trends-to-inspire-and-try-in-2020 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Pinterest class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Pinterest</a> in 2019, proving that there are plenty of women wanting to say "I do" in a greener way.

Eco fashion used to bear the stereotype of beige colour palettes and itchy fabrics, but now, there are plenty of ethical brands available that don’t sacrifice style.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://motherofpearl.co.uk/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Mother of Pearl" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Mother of Pearl</a> is one such label. Creative director Amy Powney advises upcoming brides to question a company's credentials before investing. “If you can, I would opt for organic, natural fabrics where possible and ask the brand where the piece has been produced and if they pay their garment workers a living wage.”</p><img alt="White, Clothing, Shoulder, Dress, Gown, Neck, Fashion, Wedding dress, Joint, Formal wear, " title="White, Clothing, Shoulder, Dress, Gown, Neck, Fashion, Wedding dress, Joint, Formal wear, " width=2000 height=3000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/mother-of-pearl-1581005519.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Courtesy of Mother of Pearl</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Checking a brand’s supply chain, materials and energy usage are all important when shopping, and it's no different in the bridal market.</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>Ask the brand where the piece has been produced<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“It’s the same as any other products; I always suggest doing a bit of research and asking questions if you’re uncertain,” Powney notes. “Social media is such an easy way to speak quickly and directly to brands.

When we think of bridalwear, classic white dresses with long trains immediately spring to mind, but if you want to take a more sustainable approach, then steering away from this tradition could be the answer. Opting for a more wearable look means you’ll get more wear out of your purchase, therefore making it more of a sustainable buy.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“The modernity of our time is sustainability,” designer Roland Mouret explains. “My advice to the modern bride is to wear different separates that can come together to create a bridal look. She can put them back in the wardrobe and wear them separately, so after the wedding she can wear them for years to come.”</p><img alt="White, Photograph, Clothing, Formal wear, Black-and-white, Suit, Photo shoot, Outerwear, Photography, Dress, " title="White, Photograph, Clothing, Formal wear, Black-and-white, Suit, Photo shoot, Outerwear, Photography, Dress, " width=2732 height=4098 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/roland-mouret-1-1581009272.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Courtesy of Roland Mouret</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Mouret recently designed his first bridalwear range, <u><a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.rolandmouret.com/pages/bridal data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="the White Collection," class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">the White Collection,</a></u> which focuses on timeless style rather than trends, so each piece can be re-styled with other looks or re-worn for other occasions. His collection comprises of dresses, jumpsuits and separates that all have longevity, which will work hard for you beyond your wedding day.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“I really think you can bring style with magic for brides with a long skirt, a top and a jacket and tie with a small detail like a bouquet or something for the hair,” says Mouret. “This brings a personal touch that makes a bridal outfit unique and amazing. Brides are really symbolic as a reflection of our society and individuality now is really important."</p><h2 data-node-id=18 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">Support a good cause</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">If you can’t imagine yourself in anything other than a traditional white gown on your wedding day, then fear not. Buying your dream dress, despite it not scoring highly on the re-wearable scale, still doesn’t mean it has to be completely unsustainable. There are plenty of organisations and charities out there which you can support, which will use your money for good.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.bridesdogood.com/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Brides Do Good" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"><u>Brides Do Good</u></a>, founded four years ago, is built on the idea of connecting women to protect vulnerable girls. By donating, selling or purchasing your wedding dress from the charity, you’re supporting and impacting the lives of girls in need all over the world.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Up to two thirds of funds raised from sales are invested in charity programmes that empower girls, educate communities and aim to put an end to child marriage.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“Excessive clothing production is a big issue in the UK, and leads to millions of pounds worth of leftover stock being sent to landfill each year, with the wedding industry being no exception,” Brides Do Good founder Chantal Khoueiry explains.</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>The traditional white wedding dress is fast becoming a symbol of excessive spending<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“An increasing number of brides are spending thousands of pounds on a designer dress for their big day that will only be worn once before being left at the back of a wardrobe, and never seeing the light of day again," she adds. "As a result, beautiful and expensive gowns are going to waste – and the traditional white wedding dress is fast becoming a symbol of excessive spending.”</p><img alt="Photograph, Wedding dress, Dress, Gown, Bride, Ceremony, Fashion, Bridal clothing, Event, Wedding, " title="Photograph, Wedding dress, Dress, Gown, Bride, Ceremony, Fashion, Bridal clothing, Event, Wedding, " width=2000 height=3000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/louise-roe-wedding-anniversary-photos-13-1581012034.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Courtesy of Louise Roe</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Louise Roe is among many brides who have used the charity, and donated her gown. “It was a very quick decision, about a week after the wedding,” she explained. “My mum was a little sad, sadder than me to see my dress go, but I did keep the lace capelet, as a memento.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Roe was intrigued by the charity's <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.bridesdogood.com/onlyagirl data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=#onlyagirl class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">#onlyagirl</a> campaign, which raises awareness of the indecency and injustice of child marriage in the UK. “I was blown away by the shocking statistics on child brides. Today, a child is forced into marriage every two seconds, and it occurs in many developed countries - places you wouldn’t imagine such a thing happening.”</p><h2 data-node-id=29 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">Consider wearing second-hand</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=30 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">As we all know by now, shopping second-hand or vintage is one of the best ways to stay green when it comes to fashion, and bridal is no different. Searches for "thrifted wedding dress" saw a 41 per cent increase <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://newsroom.pinterest.com/en/post/pinterest-100-the-top-trends-to-inspire-and-try-in-2020 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="on Pinterest" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">on Pinterest</a> in 2019.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=31 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>“</strong>A wedding dress, usually a one-wear-only item, is by definition one of the most unsustainable pieces you can ever purchase,” Mother of Pearl’s Powney tells us.<strong> “</strong>I’ve heard some great stories of brides-to-be finding their perfect outfit in charity shops and websites like eBay and Vestiaire Collective.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=32 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.stillwhite.co.uk/shop data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Still White" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Still White</a>, a second-hand wedding dress website, is proof that buying pre-loved dresses helps the planet<a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.stillwhite.co.uk/sustainability data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=".

Make sure you keep an open mind and always remember that pieces can be tailored after you buy them to make them fit perfectly.</p><h2 data-node-id=35 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">Embrace rental</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=36 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Just like opting for second-hand over brand new, renting is a great sustainable option. Every time you rent, you participate in the shared clothing economy. Renting a dress or a suit for wedding reduces the amount of clothing that eventually ends up in the bottom of your wardrobe or landfill. Basically, renting on your big day is a great circular option.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=37 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Although rental fashion isn’t a new phenomenon (<a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.renttherunway.com/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Rent the Runway" data-vars-ga-product-id=ba53e2be-9aab-4587-b143-e54722769026 data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" data-href=https://www.renttherunway.com/ data-product-url=https://www.renttherunway.com/ data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=127X618962&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.renttherunway.com%2F" data-affiliate-network={} data-vars-ga-product-price=$120.00 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=8ec5714e-43b4-45ba-b8d7-2623c7a43e75 class="body-link product-links css-1gunp80 e1aq0z090">Rent the Runway</a>, for example, has been in<a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/fashion/fashion-news/a27647785/rental-fashion-saving-our-planet-sustainability/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=" operation for over 10 years)," class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"><u> operation for over 10 years),</u></a> an increase in environmental concerns has made hiring clothes more popular than ever.</p><img alt="Wedding dresses hanging on clothes rack at store" title="Wedding dresses hanging on clothes rack at store" width=2124 height=1416 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/wedding-dresses-hanging-on-clothes-rack-at-store-royalty-free-image-1581343959.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Cavan Images</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=39 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">There’s a clear thirst for sharing when it comes to fashion - Rent the Runway was valued at one <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/fashion/fashion-news/a27647785/rental-fashion-saving-our-planet-sustainability/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="billion dollars in May 2019" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"><u>billion dollars in May 2019</u></a>.
