As a NJ native, I’ve noticed most of my food-loving friends who visit from out of state look forward to eating Garden State specialities like a ripe, juicy Jersey tomato or disco fries (a diner classic made with French fries, melted cheese, and gravy).</p><p>Unfortunately, my search for a mouthwatering lobster roll in my area has been unsuccessful thus far. So, I decided to take matters into my own hands and make some homemade lobster rolls to get a taste of this Northeastern favorite.</p><p class=inline-stn-player></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Lobster Roll 101</h2><p>Depending on where you go, the definition of a lobster roll will differ. Food writer Emily Lee breaks down the two main versions in a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">FoodNetwork.com</a> article:</p><ul><li><strong>Connecticut-style lobster rolls are served warm with butter</strong>. “Hold the mayonnaise and bring on the butter. That’s the attitude of Connecticut-style die-hards, who believe a lobster roll served warm is simply called a ‘lobster roll’,” she writes.</li><li><strong>Maine-style lobster rolls are eaten cold with mayo</strong>.<strong> </strong>“It’s as simple as this: If the meat is cold, it’s a Maine lobster roll. In most cases, the meat is tossed with mayonnaise, tarragon, and celery or scallions before it’s piled into a bun,” she adds.</li></ul><p>Additionally, a Maine lobster roll’s bun is different from its Connecticut counterpart. “Generally, it’s served on a ‘New England’ or ‘Frankfurter’ roll, which differs slightly from a standard hot dog roll in that the sides are flat and can be buttered on the outside and then lightly toasted or grilled.” Lee explains.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How To Make Maine Lobster Rolls</h2><p>Lobster rolls aren’t the most budget-friendly of dishes, but every once in a while, I feel like a little splurge is necessary. Rather than buying and steaming fresh lobsters, I purchased a Maine lobster roll kit online from <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">McLoons Lobster Shack</a>.</p><p>This kit had everything I needed, including cooked and cleaned lobster meat and New England-style split top rolls. The kit also came with artisan sea salt butter and packets of mayo that I could use in my sandwich – the best of both worlds.</p><p>Below are the instructions I followed for <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">assembling a Maine lobster roll</a>.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Ingredients:</h3><ul><li>1/2 pound lobster tail, knuckle, and claw meat, cooked</li><li>2 New England-style split top rolls</li><li>Casco Bay artisan sea salt butter</li><li>Mayonnaise packets</li><li>Roll sleeves (for serving the lobster rolls)</li></ul><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Directions:</h3><li>Let butter sit at room temperature until soft.</li><li>Heat a non-stick skillet or griddle over medium heat. Using a spatula or knife, swipe both sides of bun with thin layer of softened butter.</li><li>Place rolls in skillet and toast each side until golden (about 30 seconds on each side).</li><li>Put finished rolls in paper sleeves. Spread mayo inside buns; one packet per roll. Fill each roll with 4 ounces (half a container) lobster meat.</li><li>Melt remaining butter and either pour on top of each roll or serve on side. Enjoy.</li><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/08/McLoons-Lobster-Roll-on-marble-surface-both-rolls.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The Moment of Truth</h2><p>At first bite, I tasted the sweet and tender lobster meat, which balanced out the slight saltiness of the melted butter. The tiny amount of mayo inside of the bun also added a tangy flavor to the roll.</p><p>Although the lobster rolls weren’t huge, eating one was enough; the seafood meat and butter made it very rich.</p><p>I paid a little under $65 for a 2-pack lobster roll kit and it was worth it. I didn’t have to cook and remove the shells from <a href=#>whole lobsters</a> or search for the split top rolls. Plus, I got fresh-caught lobster meat from Maine without visiting the state — which would’ve definitely cost me more than $65.</p><p>All in all, I’m happy with my at-home recreation. It was hassle-free, and if I’d been blindfolded, I honestly wouldn’t have known the difference between the lobster roll I made with the kit and the kind you get in restaurants in Connecticut and Maine. Here’s to many more lobster rolls in my future!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7p7XRrKufp6KsvK6xzWeaqKVfpby0wNJomqinm567qHvHqKSepZGZsm64zpuqrZ2iYr%2BwuMusZKudk569pg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
