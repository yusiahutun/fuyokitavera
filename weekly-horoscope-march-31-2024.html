You’re fully immersed in some of the most challenging astrology you’ll experience during 2024, so be kind to yourself.</p><p>It all begins on April 1, when <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Mercury stations retrograde in Aries</a>, beginning a backwards tailspin that leads to communication mishaps, aggressive debates, and hot-headed moments. Aries is an unstoppable fire sign that follows its gut instinct, preferring to act now and ask for forgiveness later. However, not every conflict is worth starting, and during this transit, egos will be far more fragile and easy to offend.</p><p>Mercury retrograde also has a way of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">bringing up the past</a>, forcing you to tie off loose ends and find closure. Ex lovers and old friends have a way of crossing your path, and when Venus—<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">planet of love and romance</a>—joins forces with delightful and delusional Neptune on April 3, you may think its a good idea to dredge up old feelings and rekindle fires that were never quite fully extinguished. Think twice before making commitments or trusting the whims of your fanciful heart, because this energy can be quite deceptive. If it seems too good to be true, it most likely is.</p><p>Venus enters Aries on April 5, bringing an intensity and a short-sightedness into matters of love. After all, Venus is technically in detriment while moving through Aries, as “love at first sight” quickly becomes old news as soon as the spark starts to dim. However, as Venus forms a sextile <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">with transformative Pluto</a> on April 6, you’ll be encouraged to deepen the love in your heart—both toward yourself and those who have come and gone.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/astrologynewslettersignup.png><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=how-the-planets-will-affect-your-zodiac-sign-this-week>How the Planets Will Affect Your Zodiac Sign This Week</h2><p>Here’s what you can expect from the upcoming week, according to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>your sun</a> and/or <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>rising sign</a> (and seriously, you’re missing out if you don’t read these horoscopes for your rising sign):</p><ul class="pmc-fallback-list-items lrv-a-unstyle-list lrv-u-margin-t-2"><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=8.6384778012685><h2>Aries</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/zodiacbannerday_aries.png><p>This week, you have the creative spark.</p><p>The week begins on Monday, April 1, with Mercury turning retrograde in Aries. Mercury will be retrograde until April 25. As Mercury turns direct in your sign, what was lost or released can come back to you, and this includes people. An old lover might return. Someone from your past could contact you just because they’re thinking of you. And then a conversation can start and exciting things could happen as a result.</p><p>On Tuesday, April 2, the sun in Aries makes a semisextile to Saturn in Pisces. It might take extra concentration to get through the day. Numbers seem to swim on the screen, columns don’t add up, and balancing accounts is out of the question. Aries, a better use of this energy would be to focus on building something one piece at a time. This could be a bookcase, garden wall, or whole house. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Read your full monthly horoscope here.</a></p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=7.1746575342466><h2>Taurus</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/zodiacbannerday_taurus.png><p>This week, your messages are heard loud and clear.</p><p>The week begins on Monday, April 1, with Mercury turning retrograde in Aries.

Trying to avoid some inconvenience might end up costing you money. You’re weighing whether to pay extra so that you will be less frustrated, and the whole process could leave you annoyed.
