But yesterday, the actress switched things up and traded in her signature bikinis for a one-piece that was equally as sexy.&nbsp;<br></p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_6-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">On Sunday, Hayek shared a series of swimsuit photos of her and husband François-Henri Pinault cooling off in the pool on Instagram. In the snaps, Salma gave a subtle nod to the newly-released Barbie movie, and wore a plunging pink bathing suit with a sweetheart neckline. She accessorized practically with a black hair-tie and purple lanyard wrapped around her wrist, as well as a stack of diamond rings.&nbsp;</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Salma Hayek Instagram</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Salma went makeup-free for the occasion, while her dark brunette hair was completely drenched wet and smoothed away from her face.&nbsp;&nbsp;"Enjoyed the great blessings of sun 🌞 water 💧 and love ❤️ #grateful," she wrote in the caption of her post, which included a photo of her playfully perched on her husband's shoulder.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Last week, Salma spoke with Kelly Ripa on the talk show host's <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Talk Off Camera podcast</a> about her secrets to staying young — and it doesn't include Botox. When asked by Ripa if she’d ever used Botox, Hayek quickly answered, “No Botox!"<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Salma then revealed that she believes the key to her skin’s health is actually meditation. “I know what it is,” she began. “Because of a lot of things in my body and health issues, somehow I developed this strange meditation that I keep evolving. I can do it for hours because I don’t feel the time, and it’s so much fun.”&nbsp;<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">For those who are skeptical, Salma explained: "When I don’t do it for some time, guess what? The face starts to drop and everything starts to drop,” adding that even her husband notices the difference. “My husband doesn’t believe in it, but when it’s really bad ... he’ll go, ‘Have you been doing your yoga?’ He won’t even call it that.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK570pqjppldna66scpmmZqqkp6ypLvRnmSoppVivaqxwp5km5mknbavs4ysrKKsXWyCd4CTcmk%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
