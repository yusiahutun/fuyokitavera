Vermont made the most maple syrup last year — 2,550,000 gallons, to be precise, which is more than half of the country’s total 2022 output. New York claimed the number two spot with 845,000 gallons produced, followed by Maine, Wisconsin, and New Hampshire. One state that wasn’t in the top five is Pennsylvania, which produced 164,000 gallons of maple syrup in 2022, earning the state the number seven spot. (Pennsylvania’s producers say 2020’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">warm temperatures</a> slowed the flow of maple tree sap — causing a dip in syrup production.)</p><p>That hasn’t, however, stopped the “Keystone State” from celebrating its world-class maple syrup with events, festivals, and tastings all <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">maple tapping season-long</a>. And so, for both maple syrup-lovers and the curious-but-uninitiated, here’s the story behind PA maple syrup and some of the fun gatherings the state’s hosting from February to April. Stop by if you’re in the neighborhood.</p><p class=inline-stn-player></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How Maple Syrup is Made</h2><p>The magic behind PA-produced maple syrup is the state’s sugar maple trees. These trees, which are abundant throughout Pennsylvania and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the Northeastern United States</a>, grow to an average 10 inches in diameter — which takes 20 to 40 years — before the maple syrup extracting process begins.&nbsp;</p><p>Every year, from mid-February to mid-April, maple producers (also called, “sugar makers”) extract tree sap using <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">a process called tapping</a>. This requires drilling a small hole into the tree trunk and inserting a spout to catch the sap. Sugar makers connect the spout to plastic pipes that extend through the woods or to a bucket for collecting the dripping sap.&nbsp;</p><p>To make pure maple syrup, sap is filtered and boiled to evaporate the water. The <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">maple syrup is ready</a> when its temperature reaches roughly 7.5 degrees Fahrenheit above water’s boiling point, after which, the syrup is filtered a second time (to remove excess minerals) then bottled. The final product is a sweet, full-bodied condiments that’s perfect for drizzling on pancakes, waffles, ice cream… or even <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">roasted vegetables</a>!</p><p>According to Kyle Dewees, president of the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">PA Maple Syrup Producers Council</a>, maple syrup varies in color throughout the season. “The darker the syrup gets, the richer the maple flavor becomes,” he told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">WHTM-TV in January</a>. “Lighter syrup is typically made earlier in our maple season, and then as [the season] goes on, it gets darker.” The <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">flavor of maple syrup</a> also depends on when the sap is extracted. Where light-colored maple syrups made from sap extracted early in the season have a mellow taste, darker syrups extracted later in the season — and thus made with older sap — have a stronger maple flavor.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Enjoying Your Syrup</h2><p>Pure maple syrup contains about <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">12 grams of sugar</a>, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">50 calories</a> per tablespoon, and minerals like zinc and iron, allowing you to enjoy it in moderate amounts without guilt. Additionally, pure maple syrup has a more concentrated flavor than its imitators — so a little goes a long way. According to the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">USDA</a>, maple syrup can be stored in the pantry for up to one year before opening. Once opened, the USDA recommends storing pure maple syrup in the fridge where it will last for about a year. Mold <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">appearing on your maple syrup</a> is a sign that it’s gone bad and should be thrown away immediately.</p><p>Dewees says that PA-produced maple syrup is just as versatile as syrup made in other states. “We make maple cotton candy. We have maple suckers that are like maple lollipops. We do maple cream. It’s good for toast, muffins, and bagels,” he lists off. “Maple cream has nothing added to it, it’s just maple syrup that’s been reduced down. There’s also maple crumb sugar. You can make maple coated nuts, maple mustard, and maple salad dressings. There’s [also] maple hot sauce.” Clearly, the options are endless… as long as you like maple-flavored things.</p><p>Depending on its <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">total content of solids (or sugar)</a>, PA maple syrup may actually taste better than syrups from other states. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Pennsylvania’s Department of Agriculture</a> regulates that the sugar solids content of its state-produced syrup be between 66 and 68.9 percent by weight. (The higher the sugar solids content, the thicker the texture and sweeter the taste.) For most Pennsylvania producers, including <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Triple Creek Maple Products</a>, the sweet spot is 67 percent sugar solid content; this formula yields a rich syrup without the excess sugar crystals that collect at the bottom of the container in lesser-quality syrups.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>3 Upcoming Maple Syrup-Centric Events in PA</h2><p>Since maple syrup is one of Pennsylvania’s sweetest attraction, there are many events dedicated to it.
