This means that if your Kindle gets stolen and you don't do anything, they can rack up hundreds of dollars of purchases with ease. If you think your Kindle has been stolen, you should act quickly.</p><h2 id=before-your-kindle-goes-missing>Before Your Kindle Goes Missing</h2><p>There are a few thing you can do before your Kindle goes missing to make it easier for someone to return it to you or make it useless to thieves, although the options are mutually exclusive.</p><p>The first option is to add some personal information to your <a href=#>Kindle</a>---like an email address or contact number. The problem with this is that most people don't know the option exists, so if they find your Kindle sitting in a coffee shop, they aren't too likely to check for it.</p><p>Tap the Menu button and then select the "Settings" option.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/1menusettings.png><p>Next, go to My Account > Personal Info.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/3personalinfo.png><p>Add some personal information, and then tap the "Save" button.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/1menusettings.png><p>Now, anyone who thinks to check will be able to find your contact details.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>If you're more concerned about book loving thieves racking up charges on your Amazon account, the other option is to add a passcode to your Kindle. The downside to this, of course, is that whenever you wake your Kindle from sleep, you'll need to enter it. That's why a lot of people only set up a password when they're travelling or if they routinely carry their Kindle around with them.</p><p>Tap the Menu button, and then select the "Settings" option.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/1menusettings.png><p>Go to Device Options > Device Passcode, and then enter a passcode.

They will mark your Kindle as lost or stolen, which means it can't be registered with another account. If your Kindle does turn up, you can always contact Amazon again and ask them to remove the block. You can then register it to your account once more.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=get-a-refund-from-any-purchased-books>Get a Refund From Any Purchased Books</h2><p>If someone does manage to download eBooks using your Kindle before you have a chance to deregister it, you can request a refund from Amazon.
