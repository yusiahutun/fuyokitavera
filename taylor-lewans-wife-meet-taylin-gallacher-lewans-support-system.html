Yet, two weeks later, you returned to Arizona, and that’s when we got engaged. My love for you knows no bounds.”</p><p>The couple exchanged vows in Big Sur in July 2018, with their daughter gracing the occasion and another bundle of joy on the way.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/fotor_2023-5-16_20_6_0-1.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Meet_Taylin_Gallachers_Husband_Taylor></span>Meet Taylin Gallacher’s Husband, Taylor<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Taylor Curtis Lewan, born on July 22, 1991, is a prominent American football offensive tackle currently a free agent.

I am eternally grateful to all those who have reached out during these past few weeks, even if I haven’t had a chance to respond.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/fotor_2023-5-16_20_9_49-1.jpg><p>Gallacher once confessed that she could hardly believe Taylor was real. She expressed her love and appreciation for his kindness and unwavering support. On his birthday in 2017, shortly after the birth of their eldest daughter, Wynne, she penned a touching message:</p><p>“Happy birthday to the epitome of perfection. You are a gift beyond measure. Thank you for our daughter, the endless laughter, and the joy that surpasses imagination. It’s hard for me to believe that you’re real. I love you.”</p><p>She also shared endearing snapshots of Taylor tenderly cuddling baby Wynne and engaging in activities like reading bedtime stories, visiting the aquarium, and enjoying merry-go-round rides with their daughters.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Taylor_Lewan_Was_Involved_in_a_Cheating_Rumor></span>Taylor Lewan Was Involved in a Cheating Rumor<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Gallacher and Taylor’s marriage might seem like a match made in heaven, but it has been subject to some rumors.
