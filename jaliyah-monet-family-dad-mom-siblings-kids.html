And that is of course not without causing substantial dramas.</p><p>However, in this writing, we shall not talk about her controversies but everything about her family, her dad, mom, siblings, and kids.</p><h3><strong>Who Are Jaliyah Monet‚Äôs Family Members?</strong></h3><p>Jaliyah Monet, like everyone, has a father, a mother, and a bunch of siblings.</p><p>Besides, she is also the mother of her two kids, a boy, and a girl. Although it was not clear if the baby daddy was also included in Jaliyah‚Äôs family.</p><p>Now, get to know each of these people in detail.</p><h3><strong>Meet Jaliyah Monet‚Äôs Dad, Lee Lucas</strong></h3><p>Finally, a tweet from 2019 was kind of a confirmation that Jaliyah Monet‚Äôs dad is Lee Lucas. Before that, there was some confusion about it.</p><p>The patriarch, as it turns out, is a well-respected street legend in the Baton Rouge, Louisiana area. He is known to have been more than friends with several popular rappers from the area such as Lil Boosie and Kevin. However, as of 2022, he was serving a prison sentence, and in 2019.</p><p>Labeled as a Baton rouge OG, he was known for getting money, slanging iron, and having nice cars, and clothes.</p><p>Lee also happens to be rap star Kevin Gates‚Äôs stepfather and biggest role model growing up. Kevin once rapped that he was only 11 years old when Lee got locked up and that was after this incident that he started hustling.</p><p>It is said lee also was a big influencer and role model for fellow rap star Lil Boosie. Addressed to Boosie, lee even wrote a letter from jail warning him that another inmate was planning to do harm to him once he was released from prison.</p><p>12 December 1972-born Lee met trouble with the law around December of 1996 and was therefore put into jail at the young age of 21. The jury voted unanimously to convict Lee of second-degree murder. That meant he was sentenced to life in prison.</p><p>Anyway, Jaliyah shares a beautiful bond with her father and strongly believes he should be freed already.</p><h3><strong>Who Is Jaliyah Monet‚Äôs Mom?</strong></h3><p>Jaliyah Monet says she is blessed to have her mom whose name we could not find out yet.
