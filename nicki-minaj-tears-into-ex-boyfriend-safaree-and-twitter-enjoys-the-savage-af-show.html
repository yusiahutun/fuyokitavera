"It don't give you a right to lie about someone's craft just because you know that they're a woman and people will believe you. So now years later you want to come back and say 'I lied' after you've tried to tarnish my image."</p><p>"I've gotten over it now because you can go and listen to 'Queen' and hear it for your motherf--king self," Minaj added. "I've always been adamant that I've always written my own raps and I want all women to write their own raps."</p><p>Minaj also alluded to catching Safaree stealing her credit cards and paying for prostitutes, all while she was taking care of him "for years and years." The former couple dated for 12 years before breaking up in 2014.</p><p>"For one person to do something like this to me out of sheer weakness and passive aggression and just hatefulness and vindictiveness because you got caught shitting on a person who was taking care of you for years and years?"
