The members of the El Cerro brotherhood are shouldering a sculpture of the Virgin Mary out of a church.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Millions of Spaniards take to the road in the days leading up to Easter, traveling to see family or for a holiday break. For many, seeing traditional processions with painted religious icons that can weigh over a ton is a cathartic annual ritual, a time to reflect on past sorrows and current ills.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>A procession by the La Sed brotherhood this week passed Seville's San Juan de Dios Hospital. Medical workers stepped outside to receive the tribute, some with tears pricking their eyes. It was the first Easter week since 2019 when masks, or any sign of the COVID-19 pandemic, were virtually absent.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Starting on Palm Sunday, when children gathered with fronds in hand to take part in a procession in Zamora, northwestern Spain, to the blockbuster weekend of processions ahead, people in this increasingly secular country still turn out in droves for Easter.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The daily parades also are a major tourist attraction, with some televised nationally.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The celebrations date back to when Spain was a bastion of Roman Catholicism. Nowadays, the hooded nazarenos in black, white, purple and red come from all walks of life, many with no religious inclination.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Some, mirroring their South-American counterparts, take their acts of penitence to the streets. A barefoot woman in Tarazona, northern Spain, dragged a chain around her ankles down a chilly street.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>In Seville, many penitents wept openly at the sight of the virgin, some clutching photos of absent family members.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>What many had prayed for in this country with a strong reliance on agriculture - rain - did not come. Spain's drought is on the minds and lips of many. With reservoirs of drinking water running low, appeals to Christ and the Blessed Virgin are likely to continue.</p><img id=i-cfbb06e01ab45817 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/04/07/12/69585281-11948759-image-a-17_1680865255399.jpg height=384 width=634 alt='SPAIN:&nbsp;Hooded penitents of "Cristo Salvador" (Christ the Saviour) brotherhood parade on the beach in the Good Friday procession in Valencia on April 7' style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>SPAIN:&nbsp;Hooded penitents of 'Cristo Salvador' (Christ the Saviour) brotherhood parade on the beach in the Good Friday procession in Valencia on April 7</p><img id=i-f170787245f4d01f src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/04/07/15/69593331-11948759-image-a-1_1680876097991.jpg height=408 width=634 alt='SPAIN:&nbsp;Penitents of "Cristo Salvador" (Christ the Saviour) brotherhood hold a sculpture of Christ on the Cross during the Good Friday procession' style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>SPAIN:&nbsp;Penitents of 'Cristo Salvador' (Christ the Saviour) brotherhood hold a sculpture of Christ on the Cross during the Good Friday procession</p><img id=i-b4f5a4f5b295e380 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/04/07/12/69585309-11948759-image-a-19_1680865336787.jpg height=424 width=634 alt="INDIA: Christian devotees perform a re-enactment of the crucifixion of Jesus Christ on Good Friday in Chennai, India, on April 7" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>INDIA: Christian devotees perform a re-enactment of the crucifixion of Jesus Christ on Good Friday in Chennai, India, on April 7</p><img id=i-7c7cac62f3398338 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/04/07/13/69587809-11948759-image-a-3_1680868862395.jpg height=423 width=634 alt="INDIA: Christian devotees take part in a Good Friday procession in Amritsar on April 7, 2023" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>INDIA: Christian devotees take part in a Good Friday procession in Amritsar on April 7, 2023</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Looking slightly further East to Vatican City,&nbsp;Pope Francis washed and dried the feet of a dozen residents of a Rome juvenile prison, assuring them of their dignity and telling them 'any of us' can fall into sin.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The Casal del Marmo facility on the outskirts of Rome is the same juvenile prison where Francis performed the first feet-washing ritual of his papacy, demonstrating his belief that the Catholic Church should give attention to people living on society's margins.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>On Thursday, Francis repeated the ritual on 10 male and two female residents who are serving time at the facility. He leaned over and poured water on one foot of each, then used a white towel to gently pat the foot dry before kissing it.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>When Francis looked up at them in turn to smile, they shook his hand and kissed it. Many of the young people whispered into the pope's ear, and he chatted with them briefly in return.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The ritual recalls the foot-washing Jesus performed on his 12 apostles at their last supper together before he would be taken away to be crucified.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Jesus 'washes all our feet,' Francis told several dozen residents assembled in the prison chapel. 'He knows all our weaknesses,' the pope said in a completely improvised homily.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Among the 12, six were minors while the others had become adults while serving their sentences. The dozen included a Muslim from Senegal, as well as young people from Romania, Russia and Croatia, the Vatican said.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Francis explained that the foot-washing was 'not folklore' but a 'gesture which announces how we should be toward one another.' He lamented that 'others profit off each other, (there is) so much injustice...so many ugly things.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Still, he said, 'any one of us can slip' and fall from grace. The foot-washing 'confers on us the dignity of being sinners.' The lesson, he added, should be to 'help one another, so life becomes better.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The pontiff, who has a chronic knee problem, navigated the small spaces of the chapel either unaided or with the help of a cane, although he used a wheel chair to leave after the roughly 90-minute appearance.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>On Saturday, Francis was discharged from a Rome hospital where he was treated for bronchitis. The Vatican said at the time that he would carry out the complete Holy Week schedule, including the Good Friday late-night Way of the Cross procession at Rome's Colosseum and Easter Sunday Mass in St. Peter's Square.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Earlier Thursday, he presided over Mass in St. Peter's Basilica as part of his stamina-testing Holy Week appointments.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>At Thursday's basilica Mass, dozens of rows of priests in simple white cassocks sat in front of rank-and-file Catholics in the packed church.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Francis used the homily as a pep talk to priests, after decades of scandals involving sex abuse of children by clergy caused many faithful to lose trust in their pastors.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The pope didn't cite the scandals or church hierarchy cover-ups.
