Carson says he put his vehicle in park, went around to the passenger side to get his wife, "opened the door and [Parker]&nbsp;just came out."</p><p>Doctors met the couple in the parking lot, where they transferred mother and child to the birthing suite. Fortunately, despite the circumstances of his birth, Parker was in good health. He weighed 7 lbs., 11 oz., and measured 19.5 inches long at birth.</p><p>"He’s good -- he had a wild entrance, but he’s healthy and he’s a happy little boy," Carson shares. "He’s pretty rambunctious, he likes to keep us on the move."</p><p>Midland&nbsp;recently released their debut single, "Drinkin' Problem," which currently resides at No. 17 on Billboard's Country Airplay chart.</p><p><strong>Cutest Pregnancy Reveals in Country Music</strong></p><p><strong>Cutest Baby Bumps in Country Music</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmpqGUoa6vsIyjnKyrXZius7%2FOp2SbmZKueqO72Gg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
