If not, you might want to consider putting one inside it yourself. We know it might sound odd, but the laundry product can help ward off wasps and bees.</p><p>A professional letter carrier recently shared the simple tip on <a href=# rel=noopener>Reddit</a>, explaining that he and his coworkers often use the sheets to <a href=#>avoid getting stung</a>. He also explained that wasps are particularly prone to cozying up in mailboxes right about now, when the weather starts getting warmer during the day but is still chilly at night.&nbsp;</p><p class=inline-stn-player></p><p>“I can’t tell you how many times, especially during this part of the year, where I’ve opened up a box to see a little nest with three to five yellowjackets just chilling,” he wrote. “If I’m really unlucky, they will have made their nest at the very back of the box so I wind up sticking my hand in not knowing they are there… Last year alone I was stung 10 times on 10 separate occasions.” Ouch! No wonder he wants to steer clear of the pain this year.</p><p>It turns out, wasps and bees really hate the aroma of most dryer sheets and will find somewhere else to hang out or build their nest. The Reddit user added that it doesn’t matter what brand or smell they have, just as long as they are scented, like Gain Dryer Sheets (<a href=#>Buy at Walmart, $8.94</a>). The pros at <a href=#>Pest Management Solutions</a> back the theory up and also recommend using dryer sheets around picnic areas, backyard barbecues, or any other area wasps or bees like to gather around.&nbsp;</p><p>If you haven’t noticed any dryer sheets suddenly showing up in your mailbox — but also know you’ve had a problem with wasps hanging out inside there in the past — you should consider grabbing one to stuff in there yourself. Your mail carrier will probably thank you! Just be sure to replace it with a fresh one when you check the mail and notice the smell has faded away.&nbsp;</p><p>We hope this helps everyone get through the summer without a single sting!</p><p>First For Women aims to feature only the best products and services.
