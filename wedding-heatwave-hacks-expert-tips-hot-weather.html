While you may normally spend a heatwave in the refreshing water of the paddling pool or cooking up a storm on your BBQ, it can be harder to keep cool for a big celebration like a wedding.</p><figure class=videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff>WATCH: 10 of the most spectacular HELLO! exclusive weddings</figure><p id=eCR4zONMw_ad data-wc=32>Take a look at what wedding expert Lisa Forde from <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Tree of Hearts</a> and Rima Barakeh, deputy editor at <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Hitched.co.uk</a> recommend if you find the weather heating up on your big day…</p><h2 dir=ltr>Rethink your beauty look</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/74a43eba538c-wedding-makeup.jpg><p id=eDjNX62hIY5Z data-wc=59>There's enough pressure to look and feel your best on your wedding day, without adding in the challenge of hot weather. If you're worried about your makeup melting in the heat, speak to your makeup artist who should have some clever tricks to keep you looking picture-perfect all day long – say goodbye to smudged mascara and streaky foundation!</p><p id=e3YCS2DITYpY data-wc=64>Rima also added that SPF is your best friend in the warm weather, but it needs to be carefully incorporated into your skincare prep. "You’ll definitely want to add SPF throughout the day, so consider using a lighter foundation and base to avoid suffocating your skin, and then top up throughout the day with a non-oily face SPF in a spray bottle," she said.</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">DON'T MISS:</h4><ul class=relatedContentListClass_ra09n5z><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="How to choose stunning wedding table settings and decorations on a budget" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/edfe96e13a54-wedding-table-settings-t.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="How to choose stunning wedding table settings and decorations on a budget" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>How to choose stunning wedding table settings and decorations on a budget</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="How to perfect your wedding invitation wording" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/60e5056b15f7-couple-holding-wedding-invitation-t.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="How to perfect your wedding invitation wording" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>How to perfect your wedding invitation wording</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li></ul><p id=eebw_A25efk0 data-wc=24>"It’s also worth investing in an on-the-day powder to blot your skin when it becomes shiny, something that is literally unavoidable in soaring temperatures!"</p><p id=eoakUYQwaUSl data-wc=44>When it comes to your hairstyle, Lisa suggested the bride and bridesmaids choose an updo or a style that keeps their hair off the face, neck and back. Not only will it keep you cool but it will prevent your hair from getting frizzy.</p><h2 dir=ltr>Choose cool, comfy clothing</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/eef8809972d7-wedding-guests-z.jpg><p id=e7cg-Vr6BHRz data-wc=25>Floaty bridal dresses that don't cling to your body and half-lined suits with lighter cotton shirts may help the bridal party stay comfortable, Lisa said.&nbsp;</p><p id=eGoiCmFC6Vgb data-wc=31>Rima, meanwhile, said short-sleeved shirts and shorts could come in handy for grooms, while brides may want to change for their evening reception, and swap their heels for flats or flip-flops.</p><p id=esL4-uUaFdQP data-wc=12><strong>SHOP: <a aria-label="11 best supermarket wedding cakes from M&S, Waitrose, Sainsbury's & more" class=hm-link href=#>11 best supermarket wedding cakes from M&S, Waitrose, Sainsbury's & more</a></strong></p><p id=exJdbTIs65Nx data-wc=19><strong>READ: <a aria-label="Wedding smile makeover guide: A cosmetic dentist reveals how much it costs to make your teeth look picture perfect" class=hm-link href=#>Wedding smile makeover guide: A cosmetic dentist reveals how much it costs to make your teeth look picture-perfect</a></strong></p><p id=e_LeB-AjVpdg data-wc=52>"For those planning to wear a heavy wedding dress, now’s the time to consider a second outfit for post-ceremony celebrations that is more suited to the weather. No one will blame you for changing out of your gown in this weather, in fact, they will likely praise you for it!" Rima continued.</p><h2 dir=ltr>Offer booze-free drinks</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/a2ed5e98431f-wedding-drinks-z.jpg><p id=eEK1S8-w5Kdp data-wc=49>It's widely known that drinking alcohol can increase dehydration, which is why it's best to offer booze-free drinks to guests. In fact, ditching alcohol altogether is becoming increasingly popular, with the <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>National Wedding Survey</a> revealing as many as 1 in 10 couples chose to have tee-total weddings in 2021.&nbsp;</p><p id=e7aqmfDVzals data-wc=19>Rima suggests swapping Prosecco for Nozeco or sipping on a glass of flavoured soda water or refreshing homemade lemonade.</p><p id=e54a4Ixa78Cm data-wc=27>Meanwhile, Lisa said brides and grooms could add tasty ice lollies to your 'Pimp your Prosecco' stand if you don't want to get rid of alcohol entirely.</p><h2 dir=ltr>Stay hydrated</h2><p id=eJKXlWmM7W83 data-wc=24>On the subject of drinks, enter the hydration station! Encourage guests to drink plenty of water by having a dedicated area to get water.&nbsp;</p><p id=exQXqBxaiZD- data-wc=59>"You can make these look super pretty by using vintage water dispensers and filling each one with garnishes such as cucumber, lemons or lime to give it an elevated feel. Make sure this station is either indoors, in the shade or accompanied by lots of ice to avoid warm water - no one wants to drink that!" Rima said.</p><p id=e6ErT7geQ6PY data-wc=18>Lisa also recommended handing out bottles of water to guests as they arrive, alongside parasols and hand fans.</p><h2 dir=ltr>Find shelter in the shade</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/faa199030b0a-wedding-reception-outdoors-z.jpg><p id=e4l1CTbnTxNF data-wc=64>An outdoor wedding can quickly become uncomfortable if there's no shade to escape the sun. Rima suggests: "Contact your venue to check that they are able to provide shaded areas for you and your guests. If you have exclusive use of your wedding venue, it may be that they move you to different areas where natural shade is available as the sun moves position."</p><p id=eUqzu0IbGHJF data-wc=25>Alternatively, marquees, parasols and gazebos can offer temporary shade, or you may be able to move the ceremony indoors to make use of air conditioning.</p><p id=eQzM5BZd8jfK data-wc=37>"Most venues should have a plan or resources readily available for extremely hot weather but it’s important to check in before the wedding day so that you’re not trying to problem-solve on the big day," she added.</p><h2 dir=ltr>Plan your menu</h2><p id=elCjsQwxQX data-wc=56>Nobody can predict the weather months in advance, but if you're planning a summer wedding or a destination wedding in a warm location, then you'll want that to be reflected in your food. Swap heavy winter dishes such as lamb shank and mash for lighter meals such as salads, potato salads, BBQ foods and fresh fruit.</p><p id=eaU89KznGo data-wc=21>Plus, sunny weather lends itself to ice cream trucks (or a DIY budget-friendly version with an ice-filled bucket and ice lollies.)</p><h2 dir=ltr>Take care of vulnerable guests</h2><p id=eO62N90in0GW data-wc=45>Young children, the elderly, pets and suppliers are all people who may be at extra risk of sunstroke and sunburn, so Rima said it's best to assign someone from the wedding party to make sure they are hydrated and away from too much direct sunlight.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/1b9bc04c1b50-wedding-dog-z.jpg><p id=eQnI2nNOfP1K data-wc=56>"Whether you’re inviting your dog to be a ringbearer, or having a petting zoo as entertainment, these animals aren’t able to make sensible decisions for themselves and will feel the effects of the higher temps faster than humans. Again, ensure someone is tasked with keeping them cool, hydrated and safe in the hotter weather," she said.</p><p id=ewhtakk59c85 data-wc=35>Meanwhile, those involved in the behind-the-scenes running of your wedding day, such as photographers, wedding planners and caterers, often don't get food or drink breaks, so make sure they have the time to get refreshments.</p><h2 dir=ltr>Heatwave friendly favours</h2><p id=epgzwUD0cTPk data-wc=29>Wedding tokens don't have to be limited to shot glasses or mini macarons. Rima says you can include the following heatwave-friendly wedding favours to keep guests cool all day:</p><ul dir=ltr><li>Miniature bottles of SPF are a cute and fun way to prevent sunburn – which is not the lasting memory you want for your guests!</li><li>Small electric fans (and their all-important batteries) are nothing short of heaven-sent when it comes to the heat.</li><li>Flip-flops are a great way to ensure your guests dance all night long.</li><li>Reusable water bottles personalised with guests' names can encourage guests to stay hydrated.</li><li>Mini mosquito-repelling candles can keep pesky flies and mosquitos at bay.</li></ul><p id=eT3lt59AZauS data-wc=10><strong>RELATED: <a aria-label="9 mistakes making your home hotter in the heatwave" class=hm-link href=#>9 mistakes making your home hotter in the heatwave</a></strong></p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
