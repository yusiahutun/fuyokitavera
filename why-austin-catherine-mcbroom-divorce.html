Did Someone Cheat Before Breakup?</h1><section class=body itemprop=articleBody><p>They amassed more than 18 million followers on YouTube, vlogging about their lives and love for each other. As they announce their split, fans of <a href=# id=auto-tag_the-ace-family data-tag=the-ace-family>The ACE Family</a> are wondering <a href=#>why Austin and Catherine McBroom divorced</a>. The couple had been internet sensations for years for their playful antics, launching their channel in 2016, but had recently become entangled in legal and financial troubles.</p><p>In 2021, cosmetics company, TBL Cosmetics, filed a lawsuit against Catherine who, according to TBL Cosmetics, had signed a contract with the company to jointly found 1212 Gateway, a “premium skin care line”. According to the company, she was supposed to act as the face of the brand and promote it on social media. TBL alleged <a href=#>the YouTuber</a> “conspired with her family, friends, and other under-utilized members or idle of her entourage to stage <a rel=nofollow href=#>a takeover of 1212 Gateway’s management</a>,” or effectively enact a “coup” against TBL—<a href=# rel=nofollow>per the lawsuit</a> obtained by Insider. Catherine denied these claims.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Outlander.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Outlander.jpg><p>Austin also faced litigation when one of his companies, Simply Greatest Productions (SGP), was sued by the media company LiveXLive. During his event, Social Gloves: Battle of the Platforms, TikTokers like Bryce Hall and Vinnie Hacker were pitted against YouTubers such as Tanner Fox and Austin. Investors expected to rake in $200 to $500 million in profit but<a rel=nofollow href=#> it fell way short, per Insider</a>, and SGP sued LiveXLive alleging breach of contract and fraud and accusing the company of spending money that would not be returned and selling endorsements without informing SGP.</p><p>Could these legal woes be the reason <a href=#>why Austin and Catherine McBroom divorced</a>? Here’s what we know.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=why-did-austin-and-catherine-mcbroom-divorce>Why did Austin and Catherine McBroom divorce?</h2><p>Why did Austin and <a href=# id=auto-tag_catherine-mcbroom data-tag=catherine-mcbroom>Catherine McBroom</a> divorce? The couple made individual statements on their respective social media accounts, but they cited “irreconcilable” challenges as their paths have “shifted”. They have three children: Elle, Alaia, and Steele.</p><p>Catherine wrote: “As I start this new year, I will challenge myself in ways that I have never done before. 2024 will be my year of transformative change and with this taking place, one of the steps in my journey is the difficult decision to leave my marriage.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/ace-family-austin-catherine.png><p>We have mutually agreed to a divorce and will part amicably. Our paths as a couple have shifted and has created challenges that are irreconcilable. This decision comes with a very heavy heart. As heartbreaking as this is, I also feel liberated. I have spent the past few years prioritizing my children and honoring my commitment to my family; all the while I seemed to be losing myself and my own personal happiness. Our main priority will be to stay united as parents and to continue creating a stable, happy and loving environment for our children.</p><p>Thank you to all of my supporters for giving me a safe space to be able to use my voice and share our love. I love you all so much and I’m beyond grateful for all the support we’ve received from you throughout all these years as a couple. And Austin, you’re my best friend and that will never change.”</p><p>Austin’s <a href=# rel=nofollow>sentiment was similar, stating</a>: “For this new year, I’ll be taking a leap of faith. I’ve made the hardest decision of my life. The decision to close the book to my marriage… We have mutually agreed to a divorce but will remain a team when it comes to our kids. We created one of the greatest stories, almost a decade together, so many memories, so many accomplishments but every book comes to end. And now we will be writing a new book as separate authors.</p><p>We both understand that holding on is believing that there’s only a past and letting go is knowing that there’s a future. And we both are supporting each other’s future. This transition is not easy but we both are making it as easy as it can be for our family. We will continue to be the best parents to our kids. Separations are difficult and most times messy but you will see how we push through these difficult times as a unit and keep influencing with love and positivity.</p><p>With that being said 2024 will be life changing for me. I will be dedicated to myself, my kids, my health, my body, my mind, my spirit and God. Thank you to everyone who has supported us through our journey and who will continue to support us moving forward. We’re going to need even more of your love and strength during this time.”</p><p>Some fans speculated that infidelity was the real reason for the couple’s split, which Austin denied. In 2021, influencer Tana Mongeau accused Austin of repeatedly cheating on Catherine. “one time <a href=# id=auto-tag_austin-mcbroom data-tag=austin-mcbroom>austin mcbroom</a> was cheating on catherine with a random bitch and <a rel=nofollow href=#>she left a lipstick in his car</a>,” she tweeted. Austin responded: “This lame as lie ain’t gunna save the attention that your lil bf Bryce is about to get for his ass whooping.”</p><p>Our mission at STYLECASTER is to bring style to the people, and we only feature products we think you’ll love as much as we do.
