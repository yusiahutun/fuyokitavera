Fear of putting yourself out there&nbsp;</h3><p>Many entrepreneurs are scared of what might happen—if it’s going to turn out right or if they’ll lose more than they’ll gain. One common fear is that of exposing yourself and discovering others don’t think your idea is as good as you think it is.</p><p>It’s crucial to remember that entrepreneurship, just like it involves reward, implies risk, too.

Fear of the unknown&nbsp;</h3><p>Every entrepreneur has to face their fear of the unknown at one point or another.
