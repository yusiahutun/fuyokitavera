I was not okay. It's heartbreaking because I thought I was having fun, but at some point it was like, okay, I don't look well."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">She added, "You know, sometimes you need a reality check, so in a way those pictures were something to be grateful for."</p><img alt="los angeles, california february 26 cara delevingne attends the 29th annual screen actors guild awards at fairmont century plaza on february 26, 2023 in los angeles, california photo by axellebauer griffinfilmmagic" title="29th Annual Screen Actors Guild Awards - Arrivals" width=3468 height=4500 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1469977850-6408dd9426e88.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Axelle/Bauer-Griffin</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">There were also photos of her riding in a black SUV with her feet dangling out the window and videos of her looking jittery and bruised up while on the phone, as well as nearly falling while stumbling around on the sidewalk.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"I would climb anything and jump off stuff … it felt feral," she said, explaining the bruises.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The 30-year-old said she hit a turning point that month and eventually reached out to her good friends and checked herself into rehab for substance abuse.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"From September, I just needed support. I needed to start reaching out. And my old friends I've known since I was 13, they all came over and we started crying," Delevingne told the magazine. "They looked at me and said, 'You deserve a chance to have joy.'"<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">She committed to a 12-step program and has remained sober since.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"This process obviously has its ups and downs, but I've started realizing so much," she said. "People want my story to be this after-school special where I just say, 'Oh look, I was an addict, and now I'm sober and that's it.' And it's not as simple as that. It doesn't happen overnight."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Looking back at what caused her to become addicted to various undisclosed substances, Delevingne said she "was alone, really alone" during the COVID-19 pandemic, after her <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a30182728/cara-delevingne-ashley-benson-break-up/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="split from Ashley Benson" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">split from Ashley Benson</a> and when work was on pause.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"I just had a complete existential crisis. All my sense of belonging, all my validation—my identity, everything—was so wrapped up in work. And when that was gone, I felt like I had no purpose. I just wasn't worth anything without work, and that was scary," she said. "Instead of taking the time to really learn something new or do something new, I got very wrapped up in misery, wallowing, and partying. It was a really sad time."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">During that time, she was also filming her intimate docuseries, Planet Sex, and in April 2022, her grandmother Jane Sheffield died.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"When I heard she had died there were a lot of things I had to process because I hadn't seen her since Christmas the year before. I was really trying to pour everything I had into work, and every night I would come back from filming and sit alone and just cry. By the time I got to the Met Ball two weeks later I was fucking exhausted," Delevingne said.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Still, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/g39830136/all-the-looks-met-gala-2022/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="she attended the 2022 Met Gala" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">she attended the 2022 Met Gala</a> and "went and got blackout afterwards," she remembered. "It was like, What am I doing? The day after, I had to travel to my granny's funeral.
