Her father, William H. Neal, was a businessman and movie theatre projectionist. Unfortunately, the details of her mother, Marion Leona LeGore Neal, are not public.</p><p class=align-left>Fannie was an only child, and she studied at the University of Alabama. Her father encouraged her to read books and write from a tender age. However, she suffered <a id=http://encyclopediaofalabama.org/ARTICLE/h-2462 href=# rel="nofollow noopener">undiagnosed dyslexia</a>, a learning-based language disability, which affected her confidence as a writer because she had poor spelling and was a slow reader. However, she continued to nurture and pursue her passion.</p><p class=align-left>At 11 years old, she wrote an essay called <i>Why I Want to be Bald-Headed. </i>The piece earned her the top place at the County Fair. Flagg started acting at 14 years when she joined the Birmingham theatre troupe for young adults and children, where she was a backstage crew member.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/86b7736e9ebaea1e.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Gina Kimmel: 10 things to know about Jimmy Kimmel's ex-wife</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Fannie moved to New York City and registered with Actor's Equity at 17 years old. This is a union for actors working in live theatre. However, she could not continue using her original name because there was an Oscar-winning actress named Patricia Neal.</p><p class=align-left>Her dad suggested the name 'Fannie,' which several <a href=#>movie stars</a> in Alabama used. Another friend suggested 'Flagg' as a surname that would compliment Fannie.
