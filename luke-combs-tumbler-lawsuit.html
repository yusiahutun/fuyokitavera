It's not clear what it's made out of, but the rim looks to be steel, and the lid appears to be black plastic.</p><p>The design was inspired by a woman named Nicol Harness, whom the singer had unknowingly sued.</p><ul><li>On Wednesday (Nov. 13), Combs said he'd just learned that his legal team&nbsp;had sued Harness. A judge ruled she owed the star $250,000.</li><li>She admits she created a Luke Combs tumbler and sold&nbsp;less than 20 of them on Amazon for $20 each.</li><li>Notice of the lawsuit was emailed to her and landed in her junk folder while she was hospitalized. Only after the judge ruled did she&nbsp;learn the case was closed.</li></ul><p>The lawsuit was argued in federal court in Illinois last October.&nbsp;It is acceptable to email notice of lawsuits in that state. Harness lives in Florida, where it's not an acceptable form of notification.</p><p>Combs admits&nbsp;he contracts with a company that takes action against "large&nbsp;corporations&nbsp;operating internationally" and make huge profits off of counterfeit merchandise.</p><p>"And apparently this woman, Nicol, has somehow gotten wrapped into that,"&nbsp;Combs said in a post on social media. "And that makes me absolutely sick to my stomach."</p><p>The Instagram video appears to have been filmed&nbsp;soon after Combs learned of the lawsuit against Harness, perhaps&nbsp;after seeing&nbsp;her interview with WFLA-TV. Since she couldn't access the $5,500 in her Amazon account, he offered to give it to her out of his pocket, times two.</p><p>Sales of this official tumbler will also go to Harness, and the best part for her may be that she can use it as she pleases. A <a href=#>follow-up story at WFLA</a> reveals the singer and his team are working hard to make sure she's free of the $250,000 debt to him.</p><p>When his cash gift is added to the original $5,500 she'd earned, she'll have&nbsp;more than&nbsp;$16K to use to pay back loans and medical debt.</p><p>Harness suffers from congenital heart failure.</p><h2 class=photogallery-title>Luke Combs + Wife Nicole Look Ravishing in Red on the 2023 CMAs Carpet</h2><p>Luke Combs and his wife Nicole stepped out at the 2023 CMA Awards, walking the carpet with semi-matching outfits in shades of red.</p><p class=photogallery-credit>Gallery Credit: Carena Liptak</p><h2 class=photogallery-title>Top 20 Luke Combs Songs That Prove 'Em All Wrong</h2><p>Check out Luke Combs' best songs, and the songs that changed his life when so many thought he wasn't good enough to be a country star.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmpa2bmnqku8ybqmaspaKvrbHRZqOar6OqtrV7</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
