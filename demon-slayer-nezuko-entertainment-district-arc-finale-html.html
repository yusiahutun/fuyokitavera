The <a href=#>anime’s</a> main characters were in pretty bad shape when the newest episode began. Fortunately, Nezuko saved the day in Demon Slayer‘s <a href=#>Entertainment District Arc finale</a>.</p><p id=par-2_16><strong>[Warning: This article contains spoilers for episode 11 of Demon Slayer Season 2’s Entertainment District Arc.]</strong></p><h2 id=h-demon-slayer-season-2-sees-the-anime-s-characters-grievously-wounded>‘Demon Slayer’ Season 2 sees the anime’s characters grievously wounded</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-1><p></p></figure><p id=par-3_45>The battle between <a href=#>Upper Moon 6 demons Daki and Gyutaro</a> and the Demon Slayer Corps left fans on edge for most of Demon Slayer‘s recent episodes — especially after Inosuke got stabbed through the chest and Tengen Uzui was poisoned by Gyutaro’s blood sickles.</p><p id=par-4_55>Both characters remain in dire shape when the Entertainment District Arc finale, “No Matter How Many Lives,” kicks off. Although Inosuke prevents his heart from getting stabbed, Gyutaro’s poison begins affecting him once the fight is done. And Tengen is nearly unconscious from the same poison, attempting to offer last words to his three wives.</p><p id=par-5_57>Additionally, Tanjiro and Zenitsu are seriously injured — and put in danger yet again when Gyutaro sends more sickles flying in a last-ditch attempt to take his opponents down with him. Fortunately, none of the characters actually die after the battle. That’s mostly thanks to Nezuko, who proved the real MVP of the Demon Slayer finale.</p><h2 id=h-nezuko-s-blood-demon-art-saves-the-day-in-demon-slayer-s-finale>Nezuko’s Blood Demon Art saves the day in ‘Demon Slayer’s finale</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Nezuko-Demon-Slayer.jpg><p id=par-6_60>When Gyutaro’s flying blood sickles leveraged most of the Entertainment District at the end of last week’s episode, it wasn’t clear how Tanjiro would survive the assault unscathed. The anime’s main character was right in their path. However, the Demon Slayer finale sees Nezuko using her Blood Demon Art to burn the sickles away before they reach her brother.</p><p id=par-7_54>That’s not all she accomplishes with her power, either. Her Blood Demon Art also enables her to burn up the poison flowing through Inosuke’s and Tengen’s veins. Thanks to Nezuko, both of them survive Demon Slayer Season 2 — even if <a href=#>the Sound Hashira</a> decides to retire at the very end of it.</p><h2 id=h-nezuko-grows-a-lot-during-the-entertainment-district-arc>Nezuko grows a lot during the Entertainment District Arc</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-3></figure><p id=par-8_46>Demon Slayer‘s Entertainment District Arc gives every major character the opportunity to shine, and Nezuko is no exception. Tanjiro’s sister grows a great deal during this storyline, discovering new aspects of her demon powers — though she’s not able to control them all just yet.</p><p id=par-9_60>Still, her big moments in this arc promise more to come in <a href=#>Demon Slayer Season 3</a>. If Nezuko learns to control her Awakened Form and her Blood Demon Art, she’ll be a force to be reckoned with. And Tanjiro and his friends may need that kind of power when they face more Upper Rank demons (not to mention Muzan Kibutsuji).</p><p id=par-10_30>It’ll be exciting to see where the anime takes Nezuko’s character as it continues its run. After her latest displays of power, fans have plenty to get excited about.</p><p id=par-11_16>Every episode of Demon Slayer‘s Entertainment District Arc is now streaming on Crunchyroll, Funimation, and Hulu.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGSxprnOp2SspJGusrN5zZ6xrqOfYrKvwMSrq5qhnqKyr8CMnaCsrKKesLV5wKuaZp6Zo66tsY2hq6akXw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
