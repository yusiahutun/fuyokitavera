While we’ll probably never have the full story of what went down inside that elevator after the <a href=# id=auto-tag_met-gala data-tag=met-gala>Met Gala</a>, more details continue to leak. <a href=# rel=nofollow>According to unnamed sources who spoke to </a><a href=# rel=nofollow>Us Weekly</a>,&nbsp;shortly before she got on the elevator with her sister and brother-in-law, Solange got into a verbal altercation with designer <strong><a href=# id=auto-tag_rachel-roy data-tag=rachel-roy>Rachel Roy</a>.</strong></p><p>“Solange had yelled at [Roy] earlier at the after party, which was held at the [New York’s] Boom Boom Room in the Standard Hotel,” the source&nbsp;says. “Beyonce ‘got in the middle of it,’ though it remains unclear what it was about. According to another insider, Solange was yelling at a number of people; Roy, it turns out, was included in that group.”</p><p>Far be it for us to speculate on what was going through Solange’s mind that night, but it seems like she was having a rough go at it, potentially picking fights with not just one individual but with multiples. Interestingly, Roy and Solange have been close in the past; Roy dressed Solange for the 2012 Met Gala, and attended the event with her.</p><p>Additionally, it seems that Solange has gone through her Instagram photos and deleted every single photo of Beyoncé, save for <a href=# rel=nofollow>one from about 15 months ago</a>. A quick review of Beyoncé’s blog doesn’t reveal much; there are still tons of pictures of Solange to be found there. What happened between the two sisters?</p><p>We’ll keep our eyes peeled and ears open for more details on what went down that night. There was definitely something off with the younger Knowles sibling!</p><a id=RT5Rig_yQPJusYOVqcDLnw class=gie-single href=#>Embed from Getty Images</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2iblaGyo77IrbBmppWswHB%2Bk2psb2pfqLytrc2gnGallal6qK3LmmY%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
