His affair came to light when <a href=#>Beyoncé</a> released her groundbreaking 2016 record Lemonade on which she sang about heartbreak and Jay-Z cheating. Despite the <a href=#>celebrity couple</a> airing their thoughts and feelings about what happened, fans still don’t know too many details about the other woman. Beyoncé did, however, label her “Becky with the good hair.”</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/01/GettyImages-1010041012-1024x682.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-jay-z-s-new-lyrics-hint-at-beyonce-cheating-regrets>Jay-Z’s new lyrics hint at Beyoncé cheating regrets</h2><p>In the nine-minute song titled I Want You Forever for The Book of Clarence soundtrack, Jay-Z (birth name Sean Carter) talks about a struggling relationship, which both he and Beyoncé have been open about in the past. The 54-year-old raps about a woman leaving her significant other alone at home to go and stay at her mom’s house and says “I don’t want to be without you.”</p><p>The lyrics are as follows: “All I want to say is I love you so much / I don’t want to be without you / I need you forever / Life don’t taste the same without you / tears in my champagne ’bout you / quit playing girl, you know I’m crazy ’bout you.”</p><p>He continues explaining he didn’t sleep in their bedroom as “the bed ain’t a bed without you.”</p><p><strong>MORE: </strong><a href=#>Lil Nas X called ‘desperate’ for hiring Taylor Swift and Kanye West impersonators</a></p><p>“You know that week you ran back to your mama house, ask my friend, they can vouch/slept on the couch ’cause the bed ain’t a bed without you.”</p><p>The <a href=#>celebrity</a> adds he doesn’t want to end up like his parents, as his dad abandoned their family when he was younger.</p><p>“Love you for my life, and I put that on my dead,” he raps before concluding, “Can’t end up like my folks, nah.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-jay-z-has-previously-spoken-about-his-affair>Jay-Z has previously spoken about his affair</h2><p>On his record, whose title comes from Jay-Z and Beyoncé’s favorite number, he apologizes to his wife numerous times and even makes a direct reference to the woman we know as ‘Becky.’</p><p>“Yeah, I’ll f*** up a good thing if you let me / Let me alone, Becky / A man that don’t take care his family can’t be rich,” he says on Family Feud.</p><p>Elsewhere on the album’s title track, the lyrics include:&nbsp;“I apologize, our love was one for the ages and I contained us / And all this ratchet s*** and we more expansive now / Meant to cry and die alone in these mansions / Or sleep with our back turned / We’re supposed to vacay ’til our backs burn.”</p><p>The same year, he <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">said</a> in an interview with the New York Times: “You have to survive. So you go into survival mode, and when you go into survival mode, what happens? You shut down all emotions. So, even with women, you gonna shut down emotionally, so you can’t connect. In my case, like, it’s deep. And then all the things happen from there: infidelity.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-beyonce-on-jay-z-s-affair>Beyoncé on Jay-Z’s affair</h2><p>Beyoncé has only ever spoken about Jay-Z cheating on her album Lemonade. Much of the album and its lyrics tell listeners how Beyoncé felt about the affair with lyrics such as “Looking at my watch, he shoulda been home / Today I regret the night I put that ring on / He always got them f***ing excuses” and “Can’t you see there’s no other man above you / What a wicked way to treat the girl that loves you.”</p><p>However, in 2018, she did write in Vogue she had been to “hell and back” in her personal relationships. She had experienced ‘betrayals and heartbreaks in many forms’ throughout her life.</p><p>“There are many shades on every journey. Nothing is black or white. I’ve been through hell and back, and I’m grateful for every scar,” she <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">wrote</a>.</p><p>“I have experienced betrayals and heartbreaks in many forms. I have had disappointments in business partnerships as well as personal ones, and they all left me feeling neglected, lost and vulnerable.</p><p>“Through it all I have learned to laugh and cry and grow. I look at the woman I was in my 20s and I see a young lady growing into confidence but intent on pleasing everyone around her. I now feel so much more beautiful, so much sexier, so much more interesting. And so much more powerful.”</p><p><strong>MORE:</strong> <a href=#>Taylor Swift caught walking into recording studio bound to have fans tingling with excitement</a></p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlpX2aAcLrEsGSsp56cerTBxqCcrKyjYreixYyzZKysmaG5brTArGSrnZensrW%2FjJqZqK2kYrCpscCtoKefXaS7bq7Esqanm5Vk</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
