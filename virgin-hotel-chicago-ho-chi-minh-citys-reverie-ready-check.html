Virgin Hotels launched in 2010, reportedly with an eye to buying up bankrupt hotels, and there was talk of opening a couple of dozen Virgin properties by 2017. Almost five years and one hotel later, things clearly haven't gone according to plan, but the hype surrounding the Chicago hotel, its opening delayed several times, has reached fever pitch, at least among those who concern themselves with the hospitality trade. The 250-room hotel is offering free Wi-fi, free room service (the delivery of which is routinely charged for in the United States), normal retail prices for minibars, free in-room movies, adjustable lounge beds and free evening cocktails for all guests. There's also an app for iPhone and Android devices through which guests can check in, order room service, control the lighting and temperature of their room, order movies and take part in a guests-only chat forum. Room rates start from US$207 per night. Virgin Hotels won't be arriving in Asia in the near future, but Nashville and New York properties are in the pipeline, for 2016 and 2017, and the company is making familiar-sounding claims about opening 20 hotels over the next decade.

But before the advent of the train, bus and aeroplane, pedestrians were the most common of all travellers, striking out on long weekends with knapsacks, home-made walking sticks, potted meats and anchovy paste. Pedestrianism, a sort of combined sport, healthy pastime and means of sightseeing, was all the rage in the 19th century, and few men were more famous for promoting it than Edward Payson Weston (right; 1839-1929). The energetic American made a living from being a pedestrian, winning many prizes and setting records wherever he went. He toured Europe for several years and lectured on the pleasures and health benefits of walking. In 1909, on his 70th birthday, Weston set out to walk from New York to San Francisco in 100 days. He arrived five days late and so made the return trip determined to make amends. He arrived in Manhattan almost two weeks early, and it's said that half a million people greeted him along Broadway. The story of this, one of his last great journeys, is told in , which will be published on February 1.

With interiors designed by not one but four Italian decorators, the hotel contains 286 "stylish" rooms (below) and suites, Italian and Cantonese restaurants, and "a bar the length of a city block" within floors 27 to 39 of the new Times Square Building, in District 1.
