There was a lot of luck involved getting him and I have to thank the owners for believing in me to buy a horse for them.</p><p>“I thought he was very impressive on his first run here and that’s all credit to Dennis. He’s done a fabulous job with him. We’ve got everything needed to win, we just need some luck along the way.”</p><p>A Business Management student at Birmingham University in England, Lo had his sights set on a long career in the financial sector before a volatile Covid market provided the perfect catalyst to take his intrigue in pedigrees to another level.</p><p>“I graduated and came back to Hong Kong, where I worked in investment banking and then became a full-time stock market trader,” Lo said. “I’ve always loved racing and horses, but I never grew up with them.</p><p>“During Covid, a friend of mine happened to be looking for a horse to import, so I spent a lot of time researching and studying. My parents loved racing, my grandparents loved racing, but we were not wealthy enough to be owners.</p><p>“Last Easter was my first time travelling to a yearling sale for the Inglis sale in Sydney. After that, I became slightly mad about it. The only thing I’d do in a day is learn about horses, watch most races you can find and watch galloping videos to understand how good horses move.”</p><p>Lo spent a month in Europe perfecting his trade and after receiving plenty of support from Hong Kong International Sale executive manager Danny Rolston, decided to take the plunge into the world of bloodstock.</p><p>Massive Sovereign cost €620,000 (HK$5.25 million) as a yearling and arrived in the city in November as Lo’s first Hong Kong import.</p><p>The 29-year-old said he was taken by the galloper’s impressive win on his final start for O’Brien, as well as a pedigree which includes proven Hong Kong performers on the dam’s side.</p><p>“He has a terrific turn of foot and his last race in Ireland was very impressive. The whole day no horses could really catch up from the rear, so I thought the form was really strong,” he said.</p><p>“His sire No Nay Never was a quick horse and the mare’s side is very French, so he has a bit of stamina as well. Myboycharlie is the dam’s sire and the best horse produced by him was Sunshine Rising, who beat Waikuku and Beauty Generation [in Hong Kong when named Rise High].”</p><p>Peintre Celebre, who won a Group One Prix de l’Arc de Triomphe (2,400m) and was the dam’s sire of Pakistan Star, also features in the pedigree.</p><p>With champions in the bloodline and six-time champion jockey Purton in the saddle, all Lo can do now is hope Massive Sovereign can show he is every ounce a champion in his own right.</p><p>Comments</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kwLG70a1mq5mTnruoe8Crq6KbnJp8dH6Ub2ptaF%2BXwqWwyKeeZpqcpLylv9OomqRlkZyyr8CMnamemZ2eu6h5x6iloGWbpLuoecOeqZuxXZy5sL7YZp%2Biq12btrO%2F02agpqifp8E%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
