Chan has been under mounting pressure to come up with a blueprint to cut spending and expand revenue as he projected the city’s deficit could exceed HK$100 billion (US$12.78 billion).</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce had earlier estimated that the city’s gross domestic product growth this year will slow to 2.9 per cent, down from 3.3 per cent in 2023.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The government unveiled details last month of the proposed law banning seven types of national security offences. The “Safeguarding National Security Bill” proposed amending several existing laws to expand their coverage and drawing up new ones for five types of offences: treason; insurrection or incitement to mutiny and disaffection alongside acts with seditious intentions; theft of state secrets and espionage; sabotage; and external interference.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The government tried to pass the law in 2003 but then chief executive Tung Chee-hwa was forced to shelve the bill after more than 500,000 people took to the streets in protest.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Article 23 of the Basic Law stipulates that Hong Kong shall enact its own laws to prohibit seven types of offences, including treason, espionage and theft of state secrets.</p>The proposed legislation would supplement the <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">national security law</span></a> imposed on the city by Beijing in 2020 prohibiting acts of secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces.<h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Diplomats, foreign business chambers in Hong Kong ‘worried’ over new security law</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">While Beijing-friendly politicians have said the legislation is long overdue, advocacy groups based overseas have expressed concerns. Amnesty International said the legislation could lead to an increase in repression in the city.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">One concern expressed at the local level is whether a person arrested over theft of state secrets should be entitled to a public interest defence after some suggested it should not be a crime for journalists to reveal classified materials involving significant public interest.</p>Xia made a high-profile <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">six-day visit</span></a> to Hong Kong last April, which analysts dubbed “an inspection trip” that demonstrated Beijing’s greater emphasis on on-the-ground, in-depth research aimed at improving the governance by the administration.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He attended the opening ceremony for National Security Education Day, where he urged Hongkongers to remain vigilant over threats to society and told residents that protests were not the only way to express opinions.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">During the trip, he also made a landmark visit to the legislature, the top court and met a range of people.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51ku6bD0mifqKaXYriwusZop6ikmam2pL%2BOmqmtoZOhsnB%2FkW5pbXBkZLWmrcNmmZ6hmp67qHnOn52im5VivLex0aycnqGenHqpu82gZKSnnpx6orLFmqCrq12rtrS102aaoqypYrOir9NmnaKmlJ67qHnMoqqsoZ%2Bjeqit06Gcq2WWmrKlrsCcog%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
