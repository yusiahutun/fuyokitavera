He still draws devoted fans to his concerts in Las Vegas and around the country, he’s turned his passion for raising horses into a wildly successful business as one of the world’s top breeders, and next April he’ll celebrate his 25th anniversary with wife Kathleen McCrone. “We’re going to renew our vows,” he revealed. “We’re either going to do it in Hawaii or in Rome at the Vatican.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/wayne-newton-palm-springs-walk-of-fame-star.jpg><p>And if that weren’t enough, he was recently awarded with a plaque on the Palm Springs Walk of the Stars. “It was absolutely beyond words — I was so moved and humbled by it,” he gushed of the Nov. 9 ceremony. “There was a huge crowd, and Lucie Arnaz and other dear, lifelong friends of mine spoke. It was such a wondering that it’s difficult even to articulate.” So exciting!</p><p>Wayne calls himself “the happiest I’ve ever been,” especially when he can enjoy a quiet evening at home with Kathleen. “The reason we stay home on date nights is because otherwise I would be sitting there while he took pictures or signed autographs for people because he never says no,” she explained of his fans. “He feels they’re the people who have given us the life we’ve been able to live.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/wayne-newton-kathleen-mccrone.jpg><p>So to what does the successful crooner owe his successes to? Wayne simply breaks it down. “My advice is ‘be able to adjust to what life brings you.'”</p><p>Even though he’s entering the later years in his life, Wayne shows no signs of slowing down. “Mr. Las Vegas” himself will be heading back to his roots at Sin City and will be performing from Dec. 3–5 and Dec. 10-12.
