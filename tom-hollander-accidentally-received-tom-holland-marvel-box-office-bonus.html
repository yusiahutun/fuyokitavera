"I was thinking, 'Well this is marvelous. I'm very prosperous, but my good friend ... is doing this great play and I'm going to go afterwards and see him and slightly patronize him and say how wonderful it was.'"</p><p>But during intermission, Hollander checked his phone and saw something completely unexpected: an email from his agency that read, "Payment advice slip: Your first box office bonus for The Avengers. And I thought, 'I don't think I'm in The Avengers.'"</p><p>Then he saw how much it was for. "It was an astonishing amount of money," he shared. "And it was not his salary, it was his first box office bonus. Not the whole box office, the first one."</p><p>"And it was more money than I've ever -- it was a seven-figure sum," Hollander continued. "He was 20 or something. So my feeling of smugness that you remember I had in the first half disappeared very quickly."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:56d763f0-b60e-4374-9665-a43f1b2bdb8b data-container-ref=toofab:article:c4b684cd-d162-485c-a55c-f279adb925fd data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=29><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/08/5by4/2024/01/23/0898ce0af4db4258aff5830483a99cab_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Dakota Johnson Sets the Record Straight on Viral 14-Hour Sleep Schedule, Talks Madame Web</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>Hollander joked that he was here first. The revered actor has been active in films, television and the theater since he was a teenager in the early 1980s, more than ten years before Holland was even born. Now, though, he finds himself awkwardly mistaken for him "in non-visual contexts."</p><p>He said the most uncomfortable moments involve the little ones. "I'm introduced to somebody's very, very excited, then confused, then disappointed children," he shared. "They go, 'My children are so excited to meet you.' And I go, 'Are they, though?'"</p><p>He said he tries to convince the parents they've got it wrong, but they often insist and so he steels himself for the inevitable. "They come out and they go, 'Where is he? Where is he?'" Hollander said. "And they go, 'No, no.'"</p><p>Tom Hollander's next role is still not a famous spider-themed superhero, but it is someone just about as famous. He's taking the lead role as Truman Capote in the next season of <a href=#><strong>Ryan Murphy</strong></a> and FX's Feud: Capote vs. the Swans.</p><p>The new season, which premieres January 31 at 10pm ET, also stars Naomi Watts, Diane Lane, ChloÃ« Sevigny, Calista Flockhart, Demi Moore, Molly Ringwald, and Treat Williams.</p><a id=gallery-link-2264455d-7bce-4597-a962-d1f6c4a619f5 class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:2264455d-7bce-4597-a962-d1f6c4a619f5 data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:c4b684cd-d162-485c-a55c-f279adb925fd data-gallery-layout=carousel><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/05/4by3/2024/01/24/0549ffb3d9294af7b6f9247209ca499a_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3V7j2pma21fqbyueceoo6WZnpmys3nAnJqinJWjwaK4y7Jkq52Tmra3scNmq6ilXZ28rbjAp5tmpZGnw6a4jJumsWWfm7Oqr8Rmmaimpah8</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
