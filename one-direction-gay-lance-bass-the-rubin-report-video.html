When asked about One Direction, Lance had some controversial advice about how they should manage their brand.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>“If you took one of these One Direction kids, because they basically are kids, my guess is one of them is gay,” said <strong>Dave Rubin</strong>, and Lance had an interesting reply:</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Well, statistically speaking, one probably is. It’s crazy with a market like that because 100 percent is young women.&nbsp;And they fantasize about these guys, and then you have the record label and everyone grooming you to make sure that you don’t even mention you have a girlfriend.&nbsp;So screw the fact that you’re gonna come out as being gay. It ruins their whole business plan.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>However, Lance insists via Twitter that he did not state that a member of 1D was gay, but just that it is possible.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Just for the record , I never said a member of 1D was gay. Listen to the interview before you start believing fake headlines.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Well it’s all OK, because the One Direction boys are not offended! A source close to band EXCLUSIVELY tells <strong>HollywoodLife.com</strong>:</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>There is no feud nor is there any ill will towards Lance, because he didn’t say anything bad. Nor did he out anyone. None of the members of the band are gay, but if they were nobody would be scared because the boys aren’t homophobic.&nbsp;Most likely the boys aren’t going to mention it and let it be forgotten.</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>The One Direction boys are so mature! And they are right not be scared of coming out, because it is obvious that Lance was miserable for all the years that he kept his sexuality a secret.</p><h3>Lance Reveals Why He Never Came Out During His *NSYNC Days</h3><p id=content-paragraph-10>It was not until after the glory days of being in the world’s biggest boy band that Lance finally revealed he was gay, because he says he was so afraid it would be the end of *NSYNC.</p><p id=content-paragraph-11>I felt like I had four of my best friends’ careers in my hands.&nbsp;I felt that if anyone found out that it would be the end of the group, everyone would completely make fun of us, and we would no longer make music anymore. Which might have happened.</p><p id=content-paragraph-12>What do YOU think <strong>HollywoodLifers</strong>? Do YOU think a member of One Direction is gay? Which one?</p><h3>WATCH: Lance Bass Discuss One Direction’s Sexuality</h3><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><p id=content-paragraph-13><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><img decoding=async alt="Subscribe to me on YouTube" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/hl-yt-subscribe.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p id=content-paragraph-17><strong>—&nbsp;Eleanore Hutch</strong></p><h3>More One Direction Sparking Gay Rumors:</h3><li>Louis Tomlinson On Harry Styles Bromance: We Are Not A Couple</li><li>One Direction Stars Zayn Malik and Liam Payne Caught Humping</li><li>One Direction’s Harry Styles Kisses Niall Horan</li><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWljZH12e49sZqimlWKxqr7EnKuip55itKLFjKWYp5uVYq%2Biv9Jmq6GdXafCo7XNZqmeqJ%2BnwW7CyJ2cqGc%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
