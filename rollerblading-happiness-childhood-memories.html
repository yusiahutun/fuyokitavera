"Rollerblading is not allowed inside," it read. At the time, I thought it must have been the first time anyone had ever erected that sign, as not many people have had the audacity to rollerblade into a shop.</p><p id=e8tLo2wsfZfs data-wc=15>For a moment in time, I was a pioneer of a speedy, wheely, shopping movement.</p><p id=ejKeNaiWpHhs data-wc=14><strong>&nbsp;READ:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>How to be happy: 30 expert-approved tips to become your most optimistic self</a><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p id=eJjycngMIxa5 data-wc=33>When I look back, I don’t have a single bad memory of being on rollerblades and what’s more, the hobby has been something that I had always had in common with my dad.</p><p id=elfjXLq_BPL2 data-wc=22>We both love the seemingly effortless exercise and the feeling of the wind on our faces while discussing important or not-so-important topics.</p><p id=e6SW-iGvt_HF data-wc=39>My dad and I still go on ‘father-daughter dates’ where we both rollerblade.

The first day we met, we arranged to meet and rollerblade by the sea. A few months later we both flew to France and rollerbladed 21 km from Nice to Antibes, the most scenic rollerblading route I have ever done.</p><p id=e-p0bQ4w5A-x data-wc=25>Now I live in Brighton and rollerblade regularly on the seafront. The feeling of a breeze on my face helps to wash my worries away.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/541c2b877173-juliet-rollerblading-brighton.jpg><p id=e0FNUqVMrXzK data-wc=28>I started to wonder, do all my happy memories of rollerblading contribute to why I love it so much, and why the sport has become my unlicensed therapist?</p><p id=eZxZYkHMJuxS data-wc=53>To work out why my lifelong hobby makes me so happy, I spoke to <a class=hm-link href=# rel="noopenernofollow nofollow">Professor Paul Dolan</a>, a behavioural scientist and author of the Sunday Times bestseller <a class=hm-link href=# rel="noopenernofollow nofollow">Happiness by Design: Finding Pleasure and Purpose in Everyday Life</a> and<a class=hm-link href=# rel="noopenernofollow nofollow">&nbsp;Happy Ever After: Escaping The Myth of The Perfect Life</a>, both published by Penguin Books.</p><p id=ezRjtwH7j-Jc data-wc=20><strong>&nbsp;READ:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>13 of the busiest women we know share what makes them happy – and it's not what you'd expect!</a><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h2>Why does rollerblading make me so happy?</h2><p id=e5zLNCcoUY7z data-wc=20>Professor Dolan confirmed that my happy memories of rollerblading could be why it still sparks such joy in me today.</p><p id=eWE1bYXN-R02 data-wc=21>“Your brain has wired itself to see rollerblading as a good experience and it's almost like it's become self-fulfilling," he says.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/302aed459d99-paul-dolan.jpg><p id=eFBm4Qn8qa6R data-wc=50>He explains that we find happiness in experiences of pleasure and purpose. "This means things that we do with the people that we are with. Happiness is where our mind wanders, where our attention is directed in our daily lives, towards things that make us feel fun, enjoyment and contentment.</p><p id=ek69PukWGdPV data-wc=11><strong>&nbsp;MORE HAPPINESS:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>What little act of kindness can I do daily?</a><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p id=eLYbBLOh5skD data-wc=28>"I think happy lives are ones that contain a good balance of activities that are on the one hand pleasurable and on the other hand purposeful," he adds.</p><p id=e9ZR0z04_OBe data-wc=48>Paul’s words make a lot of sense to me. I experience a sense of relief whenever I take to my wheels. I am aware I am very lucky to have found a healthy soothing mechanism for myself, something that brings this sparkle of happiness whenever I need it.</p><p id=ejzxv4ZfTOvh data-wc=35>As adults we don't often try new things, so many of us have to search out things we love. But<a class=hm-link href=#>&nbsp;it's a good thing to step out of our comfort zone</a> to try new experiences.</p><p id=eFmzWkE4KrB- data-wc=47>“It’s so fundamentally important that we have new experiences and try different things," Paul says. "That way we can work out what we like and what we don’t. And the worst that can happen is that new experiences that you don’t like, you don’t do it again.”</p><h2><strong>Why do I love rollerblading?</strong></h2><p id=eh1ANz8XUrnY data-wc=37>As a resident of Britain’s seaside capital, Brighton, I'm very lucky to have a community of skaters in my city. My boyfriend and I have both met and connected with amazing people while wheeling around the seafront.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/1e3cb520b27d-juliet-blading.jpg><p id=e4hqToQcsKcq data-wc=39>Taking to my skates connects me with others in a way that most sports don’t. Rollerbladers in Brighton have an unwritten code to greet one another with a wave, warm smile or even by coming up and introducing themselves.</p><p id=eSHgsAzTAoif data-wc=51>Brighton has also recently opened Skate 360, a Brighton-only open-air skate rink by the iconic i360 tower at the seafront. The skating ring comes with stunning sea views and you are able to rent out the skates and safety gear to try out the new sport before making the ‘lifelong’ commitment.</p><p id=eAjho5SQ3hQZ data-wc=48>Rollerblading is one of my ways to feel more connected, happier and healthier. If you have never tried it before I urge you to give it a try (or a roll), and as Paul said - if you don’t like it, you never need to do it again.</p><p id=eJbdWgB4yI8V data-wc=13><a class=hm-link href=# rel=noopener>&nbsp;Check out HELLO!'s Happiness Hub for more inspiration on how to be happy</a></p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
