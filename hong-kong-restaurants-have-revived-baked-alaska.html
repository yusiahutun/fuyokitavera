US president Thomas Jefferson was served an early version of the dish at a White House dinner in the early 1800s, but the one we know today is widely credited with being created at New York's Delmonico's Restaurant in 1876.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The dessert is hot on the outside and icy cold on the inside, and turns heads when it is flamed tableside. It was especially popular in the 1960s and '70s, but fell out of favour a decade later. However, baked Alaska has found its way back onto dessert menus in Hong Kong, impressing a new generation of diners who aren't familiar with the treat.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/486w/public/2015/11/12/scmp_24oc15_ns_dessert_310_eso_1839.jpg>At The Pawn in Wan Chai, the dessert (HK$140) has been on the menu since British celebrity chef Tom Aikens redesigned the menu about a year ago.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">"A lot of people ask about it when they see it served, and after we explain what it is, they want to order it," says head chef Douglas Forrest.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Presented in a copper pan, Aikens' version features home-made panettone that is soaked in brandy, topped with three to four scoops of ice cream, covered with more panettone and then a layer of meringue.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The dessert is then baked for four to five minutes to give the outside a golden-brown colour, then at tableside, brandy is poured on top and set alight.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The use of panettone adds more texture and different flavours to the dessert, and it also has to be locally made as importing it to Hong Kong is "ridiculously expensive", Forrest says. "Panettone is only available at Christmastime, so we make it ourselves."</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">So far there's only been one mishap, Forrest says. "One time the meringue was on fire, and it was like one of those birthday cakes where the candle keeps relighting. But we sorted that out quickly."</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Probably Hong Kong's granddaddy of baked Alaska comes from Jimmy's Kitchen (HK$184), where it's been on the menu since the '60s. "We've been famous for serving baked Alaska in Hong Kong," says Tom Watson, general manager of the restaurant for almost 13 years, "and the recipe has basically stayed the same".</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Watson says the dessert uses a cake base, with scoops of vanilla ice cream topped with fruit salad, such as diced peach, pear and maraschino cherries, then covered in Italian meringue. It is torched on the outside to create the golden-brown colour and then is doused with Cointreau or Grand Marnier before it is set on fire.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/486w/public/2015/11/12/5094136ba956aeb25b31815ebd047280.jpg>The Steak House Winebar + Grill at the InterContinental Hong Kong serves what is probably the largest baked Alaska (HK$328) in the city: it weighs 1kg and usually requires at least four hungry eaters to finish. "Some guests come only for the dessert," says executive pastry chef Cyril Dupuis, adding that it has a wow factor that impresses diners.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The dessert is made with two layers of sponge cake with lemon cream or jam, followed by several balls of ice cream or sorbet to construct a three-layer tower. Dupuis changes the ice cream and sorbet combinations three to four times a year, depending on the season.</p><figure data-qa=Component-StyledFigure class="css-1yuz473 exv1azg4">Previously there would only be one or two flavours of ice cream inside, but now we have three. And before, the outer layer would be a very thick and rich meringue, but now we make it much thinner, more for decorationHugo’s pastry chef Gary Lau</figure><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Some flavour combinations include lemon, pistachio and apricot, or green tea and red bean. Once the tower is done, it's covered in Italian meringue and browned on the outside before it's brought to the table, covered in rum and flamed.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Hugo's at the Hyatt Regency in Tsim Sha Tsui has been serving baked Alaska for about 30 years, although it's called bombe Alaska (HK$290). Pastry chef Gary Lau Wing-chuen says their dessert has evolved with the times.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">"Previously there would only be one or two flavours of ice cream inside, but now we have three," Lau says. "And before, the outer layer would be a very thick and rich meringue, but now we make it much thinner, more for decoration."</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He explains the dome shape is created upside down by putting the layers of sponge cake slabs in a large ceramic bowl, filling it with vanilla, raspberry and chocolate ice cream, then covering it with more sponge cake before inverting it.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Meringue is then piped on top and flambéed with brandy and garnished with berries and served with chocolate sauce.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Hugo's manager Paul Lau Sze-lai says at least two people are needed to devour the dessert. He adds many young diners who come to the restaurant have never heard of the dessert before, but after seeing it, are eager to try it. It's so popular that 40 per cent of the restaurant's dessert sales are from the bombe Alaska.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">&nbsp;</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">BAKED ALASKA HOTSPOTS</strong></p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31"><br>23 Tong Chong St, Quarry Bay, tel: 2697 8500</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31"><br>2/F, 62 Johnston Rd, Wan Chai, tel: 2866 3444</p><ul data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-35 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94312"><li data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-1 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94311">South China Bldg, basement, 1-3 Wyndham St, Central, tel: 2526 5293</li><li data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-3 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94311">Kowloon Centre, 29 Ashley Rd, TST, tel: 2376 0327</li></ul><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31"><br>LG/F InterContinental Hong Kong, 18 Salisbury Rd, TST, tel: 2313 2323</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31"><br>Lobby level, Hyatt Regency Hong Kong, 18 Hanoi Rd, TST, tel: 3721 7733</p><p>This article appeared in the South China Morning Post print edition as: Return of an old flame</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuaqyxKyrsqSVZLOwu8Nmm6uhnqB8or7TopqlnV9mhXiEkG1raKCfo7Rut86nnmaqlajBosHRmqWtq12drrexjKucr6GmmrFursCknJ1lkaGutLfA</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
