Presales for the phone are only available in China for now, with no information on whether the handset will be sold in overseas markets.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Huawei’s strong return will have a huge impact on China’s smartphone market in the second half and in 2024, with more impact on other Android-based phone brands vying for the high-end Chinese smartphone market,” said Linda Sui, a senior smartphone analyst with TechInsights.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">SMIC under the spotlight for ‘breakthrough’ 5G chip in Huawei’s new smartphone</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Sui added that although Huawei may reshuffle the top five smartphone brand rankings in China, it poses less of a threat to California, Cupertino-based Apple because the brands have different target client bases.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Huawei declined to comment on its marketing strategy for the phone.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">According to data from consultancy firms IDC and Counterpoint, Chinese smartphone shipments dropped to 286 million units in 2022, with Huawei ranking sixth with a market share of 7.9 per cent, after Vivo, Apple, Oppo, Honor and Xiaomi. This is a big change from Huawei's heyday, when it led the China market for four consecutive years from 2017 to 2020.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/09/06/9f8607a1-23f2-470d-9445-9f36c40bb1c9_595de0ff.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">After being denied access to advanced semiconductors in September 2020, Huawei – which was once vying with Apple in global markets – saw revenue at its consumer business fall off a cliff in 2021. In 2022, its consumer business dropped a further 11.9 per cent year-on-year to 214.5 billion yuan (US$29.35 billion).</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">To address the impact of US sanctions, Huawei divested its budget phone operation Honor and the company’s vast national distribution network shrank. It has been out of the top five smartphone brands in China for the past two years.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">That is why the Mate 60 Pro model is being seen by some analysts as a potential saviour for Huawei, with sales surging on both online and offline channels.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Ivan Lam, senior analyst at Counterpoint Research, said the new model could help Huawei make it back into the top four brands in China in the fourth quarter, although there will be no race to the top. Shipments of the Mate 60 Series in the first four months after launch could reach 4 million units in the country, according to a Counterpoint research note.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Lam noted that Huawei has lost some of its offline sales channels in the past few years, which has affected its outreach in third- and fourth-tier cities.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">TechInsights, the Canadian semiconductor intelligence firm that has identified Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp as the maker of the Kirin 9000s chip inside the Huawei Mate 60 Pro, has estimated Mate 60 series sales at over 6 million units by the end of the year.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Although the Mate 60 Pro has surprised with its powerful processor in the face of tough US sanctions, questions remain over the stability of Huawei’s supply of chips.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Kuo Ming-chi, an analyst at TF International Securities, noted that Huawei is expected to sell at least 12 million units of the Mate 60 Pro in the 12 months following launch. This will be well up from the 2.5 million sales of last year’s Mate 50 Pro, but still well off likely sales of Apple’s coming iPhone 15 model, estimated at about 90 million this year.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Toby Zhu, an analyst with Canalys, said that the new Mate devices will take sales from Apple and other competitors in the segment. However, Huawei is expected to represent only about 12 to 14 per cent of the estimated 280 million total handsets to be sold in China in 2023, he said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Additional reporting by Che Pan</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kwaavx2iZop9dqbKktI6aqa2hk6GycH%2BRbGpva2Zktbat1p6grGWdlsGmeZVpZKmqn2LEqrjLZp%2BepKBitrV505qinmWcpMC1ecarpq6mlGKwqbXNmmScmZ5itrV5x56jqWWjoq6zwM%2BhpqedXZy2orrTZqmen5Geu26zy6iZmqQ%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
