Despite calling motherhood “really hard” during an August 2021 interview with PEOPLE, Azalea ultimately defined her new role as “super fulfilling.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I feel way more accomplished to know that I am able to do all these things at the same time,” she explained, adding that it can be hard to balance life as a mom with her career. "<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>I like to spend the whole day with my son</a>, and he doesn't go to bed until 7 o'clock. That's when the clock starts for me, whether it's in the studio or working on other creative projects.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Azalea said she has come to learn that motherhood is a “never-ending cycle” of trying to find balance in what she wants, adding that she has “big respect” for working mothers.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Whether you're an entertainer or whatever you do, it is a tough balance, but it's really fulfilling,” she explained. “I love knowing that all the projects I'm doing are things that my son's going to get to see one day and be like, 'My mom was really cool. Look what she did.' ”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When she became a mom, Azalea said she learned to put her son first and examined how her actions were “going to impact” Onyx.&nbsp;"I'm a lot more considerate and meticulous about the things I do, the people I invite into my life, the business decisions I make, or how much time that's going to take away from me raising my son,” she told PEOPLE.

She wrote in part, "Onyx is so so loved by his dad & has always had both parents in his life from day 1.”</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-azalea-is-protective-of-him></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Azalea is protective of him</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Iggy Azalea and her son Onyx on his 2nd birthday.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Iggy Azalea Instagram</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Though both of Onyx’s parents are famous rappers, Azalea has been open about shielding her son from the public eye.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>I want him to have his own identity</a>. I don't want him to be so attached to me," she told PEOPLE in July 2021. "I want him to have a chance to be his own person.

I want him to just be kind."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Shortly after her son celebrated his first birthday, Azalea set boundaries on social media to protect Onyx from online vitriol. In a post on X (formerly Twitter) in July 2021, the rapper said she would <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>not be sharing any more photos</a> of her son on social media.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-42 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I've decided I won't be posting about Onyx or sharing images online anymore," Azalea wrote in the since-deleted message.

"I really like to micromanage all my music videos. And I'm used to having everything be perfect. But with a kid, you have to be much more spontaneous in your life and just be like, 'Oh, f--- it.' You know what I mean?"</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-49 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She continued, adding, "Kids will do their own thing.

He's crazy and fun. When new people come up, he's not scared of them. He wants to meet them."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-65 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Azalea further described how her son acts at home, sharing that he often walks around wearing a dinosaur suit and a pair of sunglasses, which she said are two of his favorite things. "I bought him eight pairs of sunglasses, and he puts them on and everyone's like, 'Oh, you're so cool' ... so he really likes to wear them," she explained.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-he-hasnt-toured-with-azalea></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-67 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>He hasn't toured with Azalea</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-68 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">From August to October 2021, Azalea hit the road with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Pitbull</a> on his I Feel Good Tour across North America. Ahead of the trip, Azalea told PEOPLE it would be the first time she spent more than one night away from Onyx since he was born.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-70 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">However, Azalea made the decision to tour without Onyx, explaining that he was “too young” to live on a bus. The rapper added that Onyx would join her occasionally throughout the tour when she could stay in one state for several days.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-72 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"When we're in Florida, I'm stationing my son in Orlando so he can go to Disneyland every day and do the fun stuff. Then I'll go to Tampa and come back every night," Azalea explained. "Texas is another one where I'm able to go and do shows within the state and come back to my son every night, because honestly, I'm just a big softie, and I can't be without my son for that long."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-74 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">All in all, Azalea said the longest she’d go without seeing her son on tour would be five consecutive nights, which she said she was “dreading” and began “feeling guilty about it as a mother” before the tour even started.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-he-spends-plenty-of-one-on-one-time-with-his-mom></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-76 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>He spends plenty of one-on-one time with his mom</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-77 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Azalea has had an adorable addition to her work days since welcoming Onyx. The rapper’s son has <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>tagged along with her</a>, including sitting with her while she got glammed up in August 2022.
