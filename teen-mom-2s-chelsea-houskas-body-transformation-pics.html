The milestone was captured on the South Dakota native’s 16 and Pregnant episode in 2010. Houska was 18 years old when she welcomed Aubree, whom she shares with <a href=#>ex-boyfriend<strong> Adam Lind</strong></a>. The Aubree Says founder went on to give birth to son Watson in 2017, followed by daughter Layne one year later and daughter Walker in 2021. Houska shares her youngest three children with DeBoer, whom she married in 2016.</p><p>Throughout 10 seasons of Teen Mom 2, viewers watched the Lauriebelles designer transform from a teenager to a mom of four. Not only did Houska hit milestone after milestone during her time on the MTV hit — getting her GED, becoming an esthetician, <a href=#>marrying DeBoer</a> and more — she also kept fans in the loop about her weight loss.</p><p>In 2013, Houska posted a rare snap of herself in a bikini via Instagram, showing off her tanned and toned figure. Two years later, the 16 and Pregnant alum put her fitness progress on display in May 2015 shot in a two-piece. “Decided to add a little more cardio to my routine,” Houska explained of her workout regimen via Instagram in March of that year. “3 days crossfit 2 days kickboxing.”</p><p>The former MTV personality was also given the go-ahead from her doctor to hit the gym while pregnant with Watson in 2016. “Takin it super easy at the gym … but still wanna be a fit mama! 🏋🏻,” she wrote via Instagram at the time, alongside a photo of her at the athletic club. “Glad my dr gave the OK!”</p><p>In addition to her workout sessions, Houska made sure to “keep it real real” when <a href=#>showing off her postpartum body</a> in 2017 after Watson’s birth.</p><p>“Five days postpartum,” the reality star captioned a January Instagram selfie. “Still rocking a tummy that looks a bit pregnant and some huge milk boobs. … Also, let’s keep it real real. The belly’s still chilling.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Four years later, after welcoming daughter Layne, the home renovation expert once again took to Instagram to share an important message about <a href=#>postpartum bodies</a>. “Three weeks postpartum,” she penned alongside<a href=#> footage of her figure</a> after giving birth to baby No. 4. “Trying to embrace and document the process. Our bodies are pretty fricken amazing. Also. Everyone is different. DO NOT compare your postpartum body and journey to someone else’s.”</p><p>Keep scrolling for Houska’s body transformation over the years:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZJunlK58sbXCrayrnaNkwaaxzWakqKVdZ8Bur8eeo6ydkWK1sMHSpJisZZKksbp506uYp6uWpL%2BurdOipqdloJ6wtHs%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
