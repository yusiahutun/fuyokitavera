Rajaratnam School of International Studies at the Nanyang Technological University in Singapore, said He’s remarks could be to do with “the recent exposés on procurement violations within the PLA”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Char said they would have implications on the quality of military hardware “and the PLA’s performance on an actual battlefield”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Fu Qianshao, a former equipment expert with the PLA, said He appeared to be partly referring to the procurement of flawed weapons, which Fu also noted could affect the military’s combat capabilities.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The weapons and equipment should reach the technical standards,” Fu said. “So counterfeiting will surely have an impact on how they function.”</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0

Chinese military officials in recent months, particularly from the rocket force that oversees the country’s nuclear arsenal, and the equipment procurement units.</p><a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60

being conducted around sunset – something military mouthpiece PLA Daily has reported on in recent years.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The PLA is meanwhile under pressure from Beijing to boost combat readiness, with President Xi Jinping calling for the military to step up “real combat” exercises and training to prepare for “stormy seas” ahead at a time when geopolitical tensions are rising and rivalry with the US is heating up.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Fu, the former PLA equipment specialist, said He’s comments also hinted at the problems with training, and that it “should be conducted according to the actual combat requirements – it must not become a show”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">During the PLA discussion in Beijing on Tuesday, there was more emphasis on loyalty to Xi – who is also chairman of the CMC – than in previous years.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=#

chairman and said that would be “thoroughly implemented”, underlining Xi’s tightening grip on the military.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">At another meeting on Wednesday, senior generals also pledged to deepen the anti-corruption drive.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Liu Zhenli, a CMC member, called for stronger efforts to tackle graft and another member, Zhang Shengmin, said the military must “resolutely eradicate the soil and conditions that breed corruption”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Chen Guoqiang, a member of the PLA delegation, suggested big data and other intelligence tools be used to fight corruption in the military.</p><p class=postsid
