Then they fall to the ground and become soil again, so there's no problem. – William McDonough</li><li>The cherry blossom tree is truly a sight to behold, especially in full riotous bloom. There are several varieties of cherry blossom trees, and while most of them produce flowering branches full of small pinkish-hued flowers, some produce actual cherries. – Homaro Cantu</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/dfb4f108e05617cf.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>100+ summer Instagram captions that are sunny and funny</span></p></a><h2>Cherry blossom puns to share on Instagram</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/b3780b168bf2d668.jpeg><p class=align-left>Puns are <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">great for Instagram</a> if your audience can get the meaning.
