Some oils are more popular than others, being combined with say, a lotion or a shampoo for the ultra beauty cocktail, while others have more holistic, aroma-therapeutic qualities—one sniff and you’re on your way to a super calm vibe.</p><p>Most beauty brands call out these magical oil ingredients in their descriptions, allowing you to get an idea of what’s really making the difference in your routine. From the powers of argan oil to the newly trending action marula oil is getting, there’s a lot of beauty oils out there. We rounded up a few from A-Z (plus some tips for how to use!) and broke down what they’re said to be most beneficial in – plus what types of products you’ll likely see each specific oil listed on the back of.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/VOS-Body.jpeg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/herbivorebotanicalsfacialoil.png><p><strong>MORE: <a href=#>6 Daily Habits That Mess With Your Skin</a></strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/beauty-oils-a.jpg><p><strong>Almond Oil</strong><br>Almonds, almond milk, almond butter! This nut has a lot of beneficial relatives. In the beauty world, almond oil is an ingredient that will, most likely, show up in the cases of moisturizers, as it provides your skin with gentle nourishment.</p><p><strong>Aloe Vera Oil</strong><br>Sun burn? Aloe is your go-to. We don’t have to tell you twice. Aloe vera oil is calming in nature, so it’s known for soothing irritated skin and, obviously, burns, so it’s common in moisturizers, too. Anti-inflammatory is it’s claim to fame, but aloe vera is said to house many antioxidants that work to repair the skin.</p><p><strong>Argan Oil</strong><br>Argan oil was one of those ingredients that pretty much exploded over the past two years. Here’s why—it can be used for just about EVERYTHING you’d possibly imagine in your beauty routine. Because it’s super moisturizing, it’s a big player in hair care products and skin care products, alike. It’s also extremely light, so it doesn’t feel like you’re coating your skin in something greasy. It can also be used on your lips and cuticles, and is packed with vitamin E for an extra special protective treat.</p><p><strong>Avocado Oil</strong><br>Put down the avocado toast and listen up! Avocado oil, as you might imagine, is a hair care dream! It’s an alternative to coconut oil as a leave-in treatment or deep conditioner, leaving hair soft and shiny as it works to repair with its fatty acids. Vitamin E and A are present in this ingredient, and you can find it in anti-aging eye treatments, facial masks, conditioners, and even lip gloss to add hydration. <strong>Lupita Nyong’o</strong> has been said to use it to take off her makeup off, too.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/beauty-oils-b.jpg><p><strong>Black Seed Oil</strong><br>Love all things Kardashian? If you’re truly a super-fan, this ingredient may sound a bit familiar. It’s ever-present in the girl’s beauty line, infused in just about every single one of their new hair care products for its sheen-enhancing and moisturizing qualities. It’s very big in the middle east but has not yet shown up in a ton of <a href=# id=auto-tag_beauty-products data-tag=beauty-products>beauty products</a> here in the US.</p><p><strong>Bergamot Oil</strong><br>It’s citrus-y in nature, as it comes from tiny yellow fruit (not lemons, obviously) found on bergamot trees. It smells great, which might not surprise you to learn that it can be used as a deodorant. It’s actually an antiseptic, which is while it’s great to use for that very purpose and helps to heal blemished skin. It’s scent is often used in perfume notes and has been said to be used in aromatherapy.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/beauty-oils-c.jpg><p><strong>Castor Oil</strong><br><a href=#>Probably most recognized for having anti-inflammatory qualities</a>, as it’s often used on sunburn and acne and has been used as a method to promote hair growth (it’s rich in fatty acids needed for hair growth). It’s extracted from a bean that’s grown on its plant. There are lots of other apparent claims to fame, but not all have been confirmed. Often, you can find it in lip products as a moisturizer.</p><p><strong>Carrot Seed Oil</strong><br>Taken from the seeds of carrots, this oil is rich in beta-carotene (found in, surprise, carrots) and therefore, antioxidants. It’s also a decent moisturizer.</p><p><strong>Calendula Oil</strong><br>Trying to calm your skin? <a href=#>Calendula oil</a> is a call-out in many redness-reducing products for your skin for its anti-inflammatory, soothing benefits.</p><p><strong>Chamomile Oil<br></strong>Similar to the tea that holds that plant in its name, this oil is believed to have soothing properties for your skin if irritated, often found in soaps and after-sun products.<strong><br></strong></p><p><strong>Chia Oil</strong><br>Got a thing for chia at breakfast time? <a href=#>Chia seed oil</a>, an extracted ingredient from the seed, reportedly contains fatty acids, antioxidants, and can apparently strengthen the surface of your skin. Could this be a beauty regimen essential, too?</p><p><strong>Coconut Oil</strong><br>Brittle, breaking hair got you really down? Coconut oil is often used to boost hydration and strengthen hair. Then, there’s that whole oil pulling trend that uses the ingredient, swished around in the mouth, to reduce toxins and bacteria.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/beauty-oils-d.jpg><p><strong>Dull, dry hair</strong> can benefit from the nutrients that are held in oils—and most facial and hair oils, specifically coconut oil, can be multitaskers. One bottle, two uses–who can argue with that?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/beauty-oils-e.jpg><p><strong>Evening Primrose Oil<br></strong>Extracted from a flower, <a href=# rel=nofollow>it’s reported that this oil</a>, rich in fatty acids, has been used to soothe skin conditions such as eczema and dermatitis. However, it’s not one you’ll see so wildly talked about as, say, argan oil.<strong><br></strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/beauty-oils-f.jpg><p><strong>Flaxseed Oil</strong><br>Only associate the word flaxseed with your cereal? Well, flaxseed oil is a notable in the skin care world. It can be found in beauty products but also bought on its own. Known for having omega-3s which hydrate.

This brand, specifically, calls out grape seed oil for its levels of vitamin E and omega-6 (a fatty acid) for skin health. Vitamin E, specifically, for its antioxidant qualities helps with skin nourishment and regeneration. It’s also been said by some that it helps regulate the skin’s production of oils.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/beauty-oils-h.jpg><p><strong>Hemp Seed Oil</strong><br>This oil comes from the hemp plant, and is found in a ton of beauty products, from moisturizers to lip products, due to its high volume of fatty acids and being an emollient.

It’s silky enough so that you won’t feel like you’re dragging your razor against a tough surface, preventing nicks and cuts.

It’s harvested in South Africa from the Marula plant and can be used in your skin care routine as an anti-aging treatment, warding off wrinkles and protecting from free radicals as it’s filled with antioxidants (<a href=# rel=nofollow>it’s said to have more than Argan oil</a>) and fatty acids that protect, soften, and strengthen your skin and hair. This product often comes in a dropper bottle that you apply to either your skin (it’s really light and won’t clog your pores) or the ends of your hair. It’s also said to be rich in Vitamin C (making it ideal for your complexion).</p><p><strong>Moringa Oil<br></strong>This ingredient might not ring familiar to you, but it’s included in many skin care products and <a href=#>reportedly fights germs</a> and is often found in hydrating products for your hair.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/beauty-oils-n.jpg><p><strong>Neroli Oil<br></strong>Neroli often shows up as a note in fragrances, but the essential oil is actually contained in hair products like <span class="rpHighlightAllClass rpHighlightSubjectClass">Shu Uemura</span>‘s Cleansing Oil Shampoo that works to soothe and purify dry hair while providing it with the moisture it needs—AKA, hydration without the weight.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/beauty-oils-o.jpg><p><strong>Olive Oil</strong><br>The heavy formula of olive oil is often used as a deep conditioner in hair masks and a hydrating ingredient in lotions and soaps.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/beauty-oils-p.jpg><p><strong>Peppermint Oil</strong><br>The scent is one you’ll remember, and peppermint in general can be found in skin care products (you’ve definitely seen moisturizers touched with this ingredient) for its ability to soothe, but <a href=#>it’s reportedly used for normalizing oil production</a> as well. The scent is regenerating. According to ‘Essential Oils for Health,’ the oil form of this ingredient is anti-inflammatory, an antiseptic, and helps reduce itching.</p><p><strong>Pumpkin Seed Oil<br></strong>While the benefits of this oil haven’t yet been thoroughly explored, it’s getting a ton of action in the headlines thanks to beauty-trendsetter <strong><a href=#>Gwyneth Paltrow</a>.</strong> Its polyunsaturated fatty acids, natural antioxidants, and vitamins are reportedly beneficial to both the hydration of your skin and hair. <a href=# rel=nofollow>Another expert claims</a> that the nutrients it holds can help control acne and even skin tone.<strong><br></strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/beauty-oils-q.jpg><p><strong>Quickly tame</strong> fly-aways by lightly coating your hands in an oil and running it over the top of your strands.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/beauty-oils-r.jpg><p><strong>Rosehip Seed Oil<br></strong>This oil is reportedly rich in vitamin A, which can help promote collagen production in your skin, making it possibly beneficial as an anti-aging treatment. <a href=#>Experts also say</a> that it may reduce facial redness, puffiness, and the appearance of scars.

It’s rather healing (but gentle!), so putting this stuff on blemished skin is a common use. It’s also been said to be used on bug bites and cuts, for it’s anti-bacterial qualities.

However, it’s been said to be rather thick, so using it during the day and under your makeup might not be ideal, <a href=# rel=nofollow>but experts say</a> it’s good for extremely dry skin. Note that many beauty brands’ vitamin E formulas hold other essential or important oils in their ingredients list, as it’s often the feature ingredient in a medley of sorts. <strong><br></strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/beauty-oils-w.jpg><p><strong>Wheat Germ Oil</strong><br>Although it’s been said to be a carrier of many vitamins and nutrients, wheat germ oil, derived from the wheat kernel, it’s been said to be a great carrier of vitamin E, a reparative vitamin often found in overnight serums and facial products.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/beauty-oils-x.jpg><p><strong>X-rated oil</strong> you shouldn’t regularly use?
