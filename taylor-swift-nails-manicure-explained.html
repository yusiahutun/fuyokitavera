She’d given us so many signs—or so we thought.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Since the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/film-tv/a45524614/taylor-swift-eras-tour-movie-review/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Eras Tour" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Eras Tour</a> took its holiday break, she’s been spotted wearing tons of black, and even some positively serpentine Jimmy Choo boots. (Snakes and Reputation are kind of a thing.) And in her interview for Time’s Person of the Year cover last year, Swift teased that the previously unreleased Reputation “vault” tracks to come were “fire.” Some fans even swore, based on the truly arcane <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.tiktok.com/@nikkiking23/video/7274357467247545643 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="“112-day theory”" data-vars-ga-product-id=b98c12b7-5952-4f1e-82da-a666c4e05194 data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" data-href=https://www.tiktok.com/@nikkiking23/video/7274357467247545643 data-product-url=https://www.tiktok.com/@nikkiking23/video/7274357467247545643 data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74968X1525079&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tiktok.com%2F%40nikkiking23%2Fvideo%2F7274357467247545643" data-affiliate-network={} data-vars-ga-product-price=$0.00 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=8faf3519-27e6-4d56-8f60-0a3d64414f72 class="body-link product-links css-1gunp80 e1aq0z090">“112-day theory”</a> (read about it <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.reaganbaylee.com/blog/112-day-theory data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=here class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"><u>here</u></a>), that Rep TV would be released on February 16.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">And then last Sunday, she arrived on the red carpet at Crypto.com Arena in a creamy white custom Schiaparelli gown with black opera gloves. Black! For Reputation! “The gloves were an interesting styling choice that nodded to trendiness, but also added drama,” says Sarah Chapelle, owner of <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.instagram.com/taylorswiftstyled/?hl=en" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=@taylorswiftstyle class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">@taylorswiftstyle</a> on Instagram and author of the forthcoming hardcover <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.amazon.com/Taylor-Swift-Style-Fashion-Through/dp/1250906156 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Taylor Swift Style: Fashion Through the Eras" data-vars-ga-product-id=1de3bc40-64c9-4e8a-a6d4-ee65660f9abf data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" data-href=https://www.amazon.com/Taylor-Swift-Style-Fashion-Through/dp/1250906156 data-product-url=https://www.amazon.com/Taylor-Swift-Style-Fashion-Through/dp/1250906156 data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url=https://www.amazon.com/Taylor-Swift-Style-Fashion-Through/dp/1250906156 data-affiliate-network='{"id":"7f0216f7-084f-4dc8-9190-07ae7162064c","site_id":"229d0812-d901-44db-87b0-24674345b9e5","metadata":{},"network":{"id":"469ce69f-4798-416d-9432-eaa9954b4053","name":"Amazon","metadata":{}}}' data-vars-ga-product-price=$0.00 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=adc6d7e0-bd56-47ae-99b1-b80b83665cb4 class="body-link product-links css-1gunp80 e1aq0z090"><u>Taylor Swift Style: Fashion Through the Eras</u></a>.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">We should have known drama was coming. Upon winning for Best Pop Vocal Album (her 13th Grammy, an auspicious number in Swiftian folklore)—and just as every fan around the world was about to lose consciousness—Dr. Taylor Allison Swift pulled the rug out from under the universe by announcing not Reputation (Taylor’s Version), but a brand-new studio album, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/art-books-music/a46598681/taylor-swift-new-album-tortured-poets-department-2024-grammys/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="The Tortured Poets Department" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">The Tortured Poets Department</a>. Within seconds, she had posted the album’s black-and-white cover on Instagram. Cue global meltdowns. (Not one, not two, but five friends immediately texted asking if I was okay. I was not.)</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Something important happened next. Upon returning to her seat, Swift discreetly removed those black opera gloves, revealing a white manicure. When she took the stage later in the evening to collect the Album of the Year award—<a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a46640003/taylor-swift-wins-four-album-of-the-year-grammys-2024-record/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="becoming the only artist in history to do so four times" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">becoming the only artist in history to do so four times</a>—she held the statuette in a way that clearly showed off her white nails—discreetly announcing an aesthetic shift not into the black of Reputation, but into the white of TTPD, her newest era.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">It was an act of subterfuge. A wink. We should have known! The gloves were literally and figuratively coming off, putting the spotlight right back on her manicure. After all, Swift has been sending messages with her nails for a long time.</p><img alt="taylor swift fans board busses to sofi to see the first night of her sold out concert" title="Taylor Swift fans board busses to SoFi to see the first night of her sold-out concert" width=1024 height=683 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/inglewood-ca-taylor-swift-fan-emma-sadeghi-of-glendale-news-photo-1707505047.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Allen J. Schaben</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span><p>Fans wore symbolic manicures—and friendship bracelets, obviously—to the Eras Tour.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“Taylor grew up wanting to express herself through fashion. But I feel like in the early part of your career, when you’re trying to make a name for yourself, you’re more likely to follow what’s on trend and go with what the stylists pick for you, so her nails and hands are where she would express herself,” longtime Swiftie Courtney Bloch tells me.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">That’s why in the Fearless and Speak Now eras, Bloch theorized, we saw Taylor give herself glittery manicures, draw a large number 13 on her hands, or even write song lyrics along the entire length of her arm. “The arm lyrics used to give us insight into what was happening in her life,” Bloch says. “Now that she’s older, I think she feels more confident to convey those same messages just with her nails.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Swift’s manicures offer us a glimpse into her inner world. In March 2023, just days before kicking off the Eras Tour, she posted some pictures from rehearsals, captioned, “In my Eras era. 💅” A purely coincidental emoji? We think not.</p><img alt="a man holding his hands together" title="a man holding his hands together" width=1102 height=738 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/screen-shot-2024-02-09-at-1-39-18-pm-65c67166161c0.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">@taylorswift</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Instagram</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">On tour last year, Swift painted each of her fingernails a different color, signifying her first 10 studio albums: mint-green eponymous debut, gold for Fearless, purple for Speak Now, red for Red, turquoise for 1989, black for Reputation, pink for Lover, gray for Folklore, peach for Evermore, and sparkly navy for Midnights.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">She has also been known to use her nails to hint at upcoming projects. In a <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBR2kxt7RK8" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="2018 music video for Reputation single “Delicate,”" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">2018 music video for Reputation single “Delicate,”</a> for example, she extends her pastel-painted fingers toward the viewer, “almost in this ‘Look at my nails’ kind of way,” Bloch says. Fans did just that. “A specific way you can leave Easter eggs is on nails,” Swift told <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://ew.com/music/2019/05/09/taylor-swift-cover-story/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Entertainment Weekly in 2019" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Entertainment Weekly in 2019</a>, confirming she was indeed sending a message in the video. “Some people picked up on it immediately, others picked up on it a few months down the line, but it made me feel nice.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzOvgu3GPwY" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="video for her single “Karma,”" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">video for her single “Karma,”</a> released in May last year, one of the final shots zeroes in on Swift’s hands, holding a latte emblazoned with the face of a clock. A thumbnail painted blue next to the clock’s Roman numeral VIII, as we know now, foreshadowed the announcement about 1989 (Taylor’s Version) that followed, in the (eighth) month of August. Her other thumb, painted Reputation black, is next to the II—which is why so many of us were convinced a Reputation TV announcement was—or perhaps still is?!—due in February.</p><img alt="a person holding a round white object" title="a person holding a round white object" width=980 height=466 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/25-karma-video-easter-egg-1989-and-rep-nails-65c671dd190d3.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">YouTube</span><p>The coffee cup at the end of the video for “Karma”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Either way, Swift’s nails frequently spark mini trends within her fandom. Bloch emulated the superstar’s multicolored mani when attending the Eras Tour last year. She says, “Given that many fans love Taylor’s style for its approachable and imitable nature, I think her nails, and the fact that she seemingly loves doing them herself, give fans an entry-level access point to her style that we can replicate at home that isn’t dependent on a high-end designer budget.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Now, the attention Swift’s fingers receive is at an all-time high, not only as her fans hunt for music-related Easter eggs, but also as rumors swirl about her possible or upcoming engagement to her boyfriend, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a45301082/taylor-swift-travis-kelce-full-relationship-timeline/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="NFL star Travis Kelce" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">NFL star Travis Kelce</a>. She has been spotted going out to dinner in New York City or attending his games with longer nails—not the short, guitar-friendly sort she typically sports. “I thought the longer nails were a reference to Reputation, because she has longer, clawlike nails in the ‘Look What You Made Me Do’ video,” Bloch says. Perhaps they were a Reputation Easter egg. Or perhaps they were just a woman trying out a new look over the holidays while taking a few weeks off from her demanding job. But could it really be that simple?</p><img alt="a woman in a dress" title="a woman in a dress" width=980 height=653 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/taylor-swift-bathtub-music-video-65c672aede311.jpeg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">YouTube</span><p>Swift’s red nails in the video for “Look What You Made Me Do”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">May we present another theory: In “You’re Losing Me,” a Midnights single recorded in December 2021 but not released until almost two years later, Swift sings: “I sent you signals and bit my nails down to the quick.” Rumored to be about her ex Joe Alwyn, the song tells the story of a frustrated Swift on the cusp of deciding to walk away from the relationship. If Swift does bite her nails when she’s nervous—well, nail polish can be a way of curbing that habit. Fake nails, however, make nail-biting nearly impossible. Could the extensions she’s wearing be a signal to fans that Swift is feeling more secure?</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">What we do know is that those longer nails were most certainly a press-on, says celebrity nail artist and <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.tweezerman.com/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Tweezerman class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Tweezerman</a> ambassador <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.instagram.com/tombachik/?hl=en" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Tom Bachik" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Tom Bachik</a>, who works with Selena Gomez and Jennifer Lopez. “Once I’ve measured a client, I can create a custom, full-coverage nail that is fit and shaped to them,” said Bachik. “When a client sends me creative ideas early enough, I can create custom looks ahead of time.” In other words, celebrities can change their nails faster than you can say sabotage.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">It’s well documented that Swift enjoys painting her own nails, but she has been quietly working with nail artist <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.instagram.com/p/C2-KkemrGce/?hl=en" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Lisa Peña-Wong" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Lisa Peña-Wong</a> for the last three years for big red carpet moments, like the Grammys in 2021, 2023, and 2024—as well as the vividly colorful <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7QlX3yR2xs" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="video for “Bejeweled.”" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">video for “Bejeweled.”</a> (Peña-Wong posted on Instagram that Swift is all about a DIY manicure on tour). The star’s new affinity for press-ons allows her the flexibility of going back to a shorter nail when her tour resumes, but also to experiment with color and shape when she’s off duty—and the ability to continue sending us messages through her precisely coded manis. (For what it’s worth, the white Grammy nails are still intact while Swift currently tours Tokyo. But what polish color or shape will this weekend’s <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a46569410/kansas-city-chiefs-super-bowl-taylor-swift-easter-eggs-13/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="football festivities" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">football festivities</a> bring?)</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">She may have gotten us this time with the Reputation (Taylor’s Version) and Tortured Poets Department switcheroo, but next time we’ll know that the proof, dear reader, is in the polish. Never trust a gloved hand again.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Because remember: In Taylor Swift’s world, nothing is accidental. Not even a manicure.</p><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/14c3069f-31a0-4f5a-9c90-463bf7712183_1703600547.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Todd Plummer" title="Headshot of Todd Plummer" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Todd Plummer is a Boston-based writer who covers style, entertainment, and travel.
