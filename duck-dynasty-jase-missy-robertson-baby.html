The <a href=#>Duck Dynasty</a> couple — both&nbsp;over 50 years old — shared the news on social media and on their&nbsp;Unashamed podcast.</p><p>The newborn baby boy is not their biological child, and it remains to be seen how long they'll care for him. It's not, however, a short-term arrangement. Missy Robertson was doing media for her children's book when she got a call.</p><p>"It was from one of the girls that we've done ministry with in the past," she shares. "She mentioned another girl that was also involved in all that ministry&nbsp;... She was in jail, just had a baby and signed him over to me. I said, 'Do what?'"</p><p>The baby was two days old and ready to go home, which was a lot to take in for the couple. Jase Robertson's response was very positive from the get-go. His wife shares that he said "That's amazing" and adds that Jase had baptized&nbsp;this woman two years ago, and Phil had talked about Jesus with her.</p><p>"Living a life of addiction and having a baby and (she) thought of us as the safest place for this baby to go," Missy Robertson says. Both of them consider the new baby boy a blessing.</p><p>"Please pray for this baby, his mother and for us during this uncertain time," Jase Robertson writes. "My wife is a rock star!"</p><p>The Instagram photos he chose feature his wife with her book, as well as the new baby's toes. Together, Jase and Missy Robertson have three children: Cole, Reed and Mia.</p><p><strong>See Ducky Dynasty Star Jep Robertson's House:&nbsp;</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmna2ToHqlxc2aqq2xXZ%2ButLGMpqCsq6liv7CuxKurrKeeYq%2Birtho</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
