The <strong>best long-lasting nail polishes </strong>not only save working hands from denting their fine-tuned mani, but they also <strong>glide on smooth</strong>, <strong>spread easily</strong>, and <strong>dry fast</strong>. And, although we’ll never relinquish our nourishing <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>cuticle oils</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>strengthening treatments</a>, it’s a bonus if their formulas contain ingredients that boost nail health, too.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Maybe one day the argument in favor of peeling, flakey polish will get legs (ripped tights had their moment after all), but, until then, we’re sticking with what we know works: A streak and smudge-free finish that lasts long enough to make it from our Monday morning conference calls to the Sunday brunch debrief.&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-essie-gel-couture-longwear-nail-polish></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Overall</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Essie Gel Couture Nail Polish</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Essie Gel Couture Longwear Nail Polish" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/VvQFbgtNjS4BgNGzyvEawEaRRP8=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Essie-Gel-Couture-bad2ffbb031f436399a91d427af43713.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> Even without a base coat this gel-like polish is extremely long-lasting and still easy to remove.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>Some shades require a couple of coats to see color payoff.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Touting a stellar reputation among professionals and novices alike, Essie’s line of longwear polish is <strong>quick-drying</strong>, <strong>durable</strong>, and looks far more luxe than what its<strong> affordable price tag</strong> might suggest.

So, swoon with us over its artist’s wheel of pastel and deep-hued shimmer and glossy varnishes that swipe on easily — although the lighter colors may take a couple of coats — and cleanly with no globby trail left behind. Following its two-step system, the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>celebrity-manicurist-approved</a> gel polish lasts up to two weeks, making it one of the safest ways to achieve the enviable,<strong> high-shine</strong> finish of a fresh gel mani without exposure to harmful UV light.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Colors: </strong>45<strong> </strong>|<strong> System: </strong>Yes<strong> </strong>|<strong> Finish: </strong>Glossy | <strong>Wear: </strong>14 days<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-drugstore-sally-hansen-miracle-gel-nail-polish></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Drugstore</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Sally Hansen Miracle Gel</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Sally Hansen Miracle Gel Nail Polish" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/Fy9AboYCiqY8li7pJP0yoVez7Fg=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/sally-hansen-miracle-gel-nail-polish-04fd535a19be4d74ab1f29d4f34ed451.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> The gel polish doesn’t require a UV light.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> It might clump with too many coats.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Don’t discount this drugstore standby — in fact, we’ve spotted the polish on <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Jennifer Coolidge</a> and the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Golden Globes red carpet</a>. &nbsp;It’s one of the best options we found when it comes to color payoff after only one coat, which is a good thing considering it could start to glob up after several layers.

The formula uses a resin complex that is made up of polyester and acrylic, allowing it to <strong>easily adhere</strong> to the nail, so that the application is seamless. The formula also contains hexanal, which is packed with <strong>calcium</strong> and <strong>magnesium</strong>, to <strong>strengthen the nail</strong> and extend the life of the polish.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Better yet, the wide-set brush makes smooth application much easier, even when using your non-dominant hand.

So,you can truly customize exactly what colors you want in your new nail polish collection. The polishes are also <strong>vegan</strong> and <strong>cruelty-free </strong>and have one of the best , gel-like formulas we’ve tried. The thicker texture does mean your nails need to dry for longer, but the lasting results make it totally worth it.

A decal? A snazzy piece of technology? Turns out, the answer is all three. The brand truly puts the power back in consumers’ hands and designed an <strong>odorless nail polish</strong> and <strong>pen-style applicator</strong> that makes for a mess-free application. Not to mention, you tell the brand which eye-catching shade you want next, not the other way around, by voting online ahead of a new launch. Its mesmerizing and otherworldly,<strong> intergalactic shades</strong> certainly matched the energetic, complex looks during the 2024 NYFW show for the captivating indie-darling brand Dauphinette. But, celebrity nail artist Holly Falcone also partnered with the brand for the show because it's<strong> easy peel-off polish</strong> allowed models to switch out looks seamlessly. That’s right, there’s no top coat, no nail polish remover, and no basic energy in sight — this is one terrific tool we’ll have in all our pockets moving forward.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-49 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Colors:</strong> 8 |<strong> System:</strong> No | <strong>Finish: </strong>Glossy | <strong>Wear: </strong>Unknown</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-to-keep-in-mind></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What to Keep in Mind</span></h2><ul id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><li><strong>Color: </strong>To choose the most flattering nude nail polish, know your undertone: warm, cool, or neutral, then choose a light pink or beige with the coordinating undertone. “Another way to decide what color will look good on you is to look in your closet to see what colors you are already attracted to and look good on you – if you can wear it on your body you can wear it on your nails,” says celebrity nail artist <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>Michelle Saunders</a>. However, our experts agree that there are ultimately no rules when choosing your shade. “A non-negotiable for me is that the nail polish you wear has to make you feel happy and confident,” says licensed lacquer artist <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nocaes>Sigourney Nuñez</a>. “If it doesn’t, it’s not the right color for you!”</li><li><strong>Finish: </strong>While your preferred finish is a matter of preference, whether that’s matte, cream, sheer, or metallic, some may last longer than others. For instance, “shimmer, metallic, and glitter finishes stay on a bit longer due to its added texture,” says Saunders.</li><li><strong>Formula: </strong>“A main ingredient that provides longer wear is something called plasticizers,” says licensed manicurist <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel=nocaes>Hannah Lee</a>, who adds “This keeps the resin flexible once it's dry.” Some formulas also include nourishing ingredients to hydrate and strengthen your nails and the surrounding skin such as jojoba oil, argan oil, and biotin. And, for added peace of mind, you may want a polish labeled “10-free,” which means its formula omits 10 of the most common toxic ingredients, including formaldehyde, parabens, and sometimes fragrance, that can be hard on your nails and potentially your overall health.&nbsp;<span class=ql-inline-citation data-cite=1></span><br></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-your-questions-answered></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Your Questions, Answered</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>How do you get nail polish to stay on for a long time?&nbsp;</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Proper nail prep of the surrounding skin and nail plate is going to make a huge difference in the longevity of your DIY manicure, says Nuñez. After you’ve filed your nails, she suggests removing excess oils with a lint-free wipe and isopropyl alcohol to help with adhesion and create lastingness.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Additionally, she adds that you should “Never skip a base coat – not only will this help prevent any nail stains, it also acts as a double-sided sticky tape and helps the nail polish color grip to the nail better.” All of our experts also agree that applying a top coat is a must as well, and Saunders adds “Sometimes I use two top coats for maximum shine and adhesion.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Finally, never forget cuticle oil. It prevents premature chipping by making nails flexible and less brittle, “so nail products move with the nail instead of chipping off,” says Saunders, who often opts for 100 percent avocado oil. As Nuñez explains: “Think of it like chapstick for your lips or serum for your face – cuticle oil is a moisturizing product that can prevent your nails from getting brittle and breaking.”&nbsp;</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Why does nail polish chip after two days?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While chipping is a natural part of the wear and tear of a manicure, Lee says that “nail polish typically chips due to not including base and top coat, but other factors can come into play like how harsh you are with your hands, or if they are in water a lot.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">To help this from happening in the early days of your manicure, Nuñez suggests wrapping the free edge (the very tip of the nail that extends past your skin) with nail polish. “Swiping your brush at the free edge and sealing the color in will help with any early chipping,” says Nuñez, who adds, “You can also reapply your top coat on the third or fourth day to seal the color and have that maximum shine.”</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>How do you apply nail polish for beginners?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“Make sure to not apply coats that are too thick since it will flood the cuticle area,” says Lee.&nbsp; And, pro-tip, Less says that “if you struggle with shaky hands, try and place your pinky down on something solid for stability.” But, since mistakes are inevitable, it’s a good idea to always keep a clean, secondary brush nearby. “If in the event you happen to paint outside the lines and get polish on the surrounding skin, dip a clean-up brush (it can be an old concealer brush) in nail polish remover to help get that beautiful salon-quality finish,” says Nuñez.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-why-shop-with-us></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Why Shop With Us</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Irene Richardson</a> is a beauty and fashion commerce writer for InStyle.<strong> </strong>For this article, she relied on expert insight from licensed manicurists Sigourney Nuñez and Hannah Lee and celebrity manicurist and Founder of Saunders & James Nail Care, Michelle Saunders.&nbsp;<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57wZ6YrqypZLuitcusZqWnnpx6ra3SraCnn12jrqq4jKmmpaGjnQ%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
