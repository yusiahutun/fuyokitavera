The actress got the idea of starting a business after she became a mother for the first time in 2011. She did research on children’s clothes and products, and found out that the safest offerings could actually be created with natural ingredients with reasonable prices, compared to more expensive ones on the market, according to The Wall Street Journal. “Because mothers don’t know what these products are, they look to expensive and famous brands,” she said.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2021/10/29/d2969261-5bd3-41a1-a28c-471a55f0748a_d7491f3d.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The idea turned into a shop, also named Lyanature, selling organic and chemical-free children’s clothes and baby skin care at prices ranging between US$18 and US$27 per product. Part of the profits goes to supporting junior schools that Lee and her husband, Jeong Ho-young, have helped build in China and Myanmar, The Wall Street Journal added.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuqKzwLOgp52jZMC1xcueZpydnJqvs7XTsmaaqqSesK2xjmxobmxhZ4BwtM6wZKWdlWLGsMHNoGSanV2XsqStzJ5kqKaVYriwvsSaqmagmZy1pr%2FTZqeaoZRirqTA0Z6qrJ2j</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
