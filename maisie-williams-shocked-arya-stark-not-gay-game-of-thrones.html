"That was a surprise."</p><p>There were several reasons people were uncomfortable with the scene, not the least of which was the fact Williams was 15 when the show began, making the whole thing just feel a bit icky.</p><p>On top of that, Arya had developed into one of the most badass characters on television, regardless of her sexuality. And despite the fact that "Game of Thrones" was an obnoxiously sexed-up show, Arya had managed to steer clear of that through her dark and dangerous journey.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:3c055dca-3c32-54e5-a35f-c622899b7cf6 data-container-ref=toofab:article:a00acaed-6c9f-4f8a-b5e0-c0c21299b784 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/02/5by4/2019/04/30/0275346ad5485c15902c062b7cdd9808_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Instagram</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Maisie Williams Shares Funny Video of How She's Feeling After That 'Game of Thrones' Scene</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>While her sexuality was never in question, Arya always stood out from her sister Sansa (Sophie Turner) because she was so different in every way. An unabashed tomboy, she had no interest in the feminine trappings of society, shirking them at every opportunity. There was even some considering that she might be genderfluid or transgender.</p><p>Arya was strong, independent and fearless across the show's run becoming one of the show's most popular characters.</p><p>In other words, the sex scene was totally unnecessary, superfluous and served nothing for her character arc. And you couldn't exactly call it fan service, because the fans weren't asking for it, and they weren't altogether thrilled when it happened.</p><p>Many also weren't buying it, fully convinced and invested in her being "queer" by this point. Even Teen Vogue pulled some old tweets from the time of fans frustrated by the scene.</p><p>"Arya Stark not being a powerful lesbian is the LEAST believable thing in this show about zombies and dragons," wrote one fan, per the outlet.</p><a id=gallery-link-d2b5c546-09d2-4fba-bf5d-a9e85c962fb6 class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:d2b5c546-09d2-4fba-bf5d-a9e85c962fb6 data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:a00acaed-6c9f-4f8a-b5e0-c0c21299b784 data-gallery-layout=carousel><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/be/4by3/2022/03/30/bedd0b7cec144767aa5c8d3887a8d867_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3N7j29mam5foq6qv8ieZLChnKG2ornSZqqhp5OgsqV5wKuwmmWjqa6zt4ynpq1ll5bGbrPAppxmp5Ziwam%2BzqecrGc%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
