For all he could care, you could walk down the aisle in a burlap sack, and he will still say you are the most gorgeous woman on the planet. While that is fine and dandy, there's a great chance you don't want to be the worst-dressed bride.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/036c53cbc4a7aa36.jpg><p class=align-left>The wedding gown is the top priority for most women when it comes to their marriage ceremony. Everything else might be perfect, but if the dress doesn't cut the mustard, then it's pointless. Choosing a wedding dress can be difficult, and anyone can make a bad decision. If you don’t choose a nice and elegant wedding dress that fits your body shape, you can regret it all your life.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/6e7d53ddcc5ef0e0.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>What to write in bridal shower card: 100+ best wishes and messages</span></p></a><h2>List of the worst wedding dresses of all time</h2><p class=align-left>Your wedding dress will be the centre of attention during the wedding ceremony, and you want to make it as special as you possibly can. The bad wedding dresses of all time have made brides noticeable for all the wrong reasons. Here is a list of some of the ugly wedding dresses that brides wore on their big day.</p><h3>1. Pamela Anderson's bikini wedding dress</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/6e7d53ddcc5ef0e0.jpg><p class=align-left>Here comes the bride, all dressed in a swimsuit? The bikini is one of the most inappropriate wedding dresses of all time. If anyone was willing to bear all at their wedding, it was bound to be Pamela Anderson and Kid Rock. When the pair tied the knot on a yacht in St. Tropez, the bride rocked a teensy white bikini. Hey – at least it was white.</p><h3>2. Katie Price wedding dress</h3><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/0fgjhs1mtsg5etiv78.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Most expensive wedding dresses ever made: Find your favourite</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/59ff54f86a5b0a0f.jpg><p class=align-left>This is one of the worst <a href=#>celebrity</a> wedding dresses. Usually, celebrity brides are rich enough to bag beautiful wedding dresses to prevent any fashion faux pas. Katie Price's wedding gown left her fans open-mouthed and wondering whether her bridal gown choice was actually a joke or not. At her wedding to Kieran Hyler, she wore a short gown that left most of her body parts exposed.</p><h3>3. A real cake for a wedding gown</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/0fgjhs1mtsg5etiv78.jpg><p class=align-left>On her big day, the bride chose an outfit made out of a giant cake covered in white icing. How she could manage to waddle down the aisle in such an outfit is anyone's guess, but it appeared to be the perfect fit for the sweet-toothed beauty who enjoyed a tasty treat by snacking on a slice of her skirt.</p><h3>4. Worst wedding dress for a pregnant bride</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/3f7c7671697bcb37.jpg><p class=align-left>This is a perfect example of a wedding dresses gone wrong. Walking down the aisle pregnant can be stunning. Nothing glows like a pregnant bride. However, you may not want to emphasize the tummy by cutting out a giant hole in the middle of your dress like the bride in the picture. Did the bride want her unborn baby to witness the wedding too?</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/49e954fa5031380c.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Grammy Awards 2020: The best and worst dressed celebrities</span></p></a><h3>5. Nothing left to chance</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/2c071f2ba8ae0d33.jpg><p class=align-left>This is one of the awesomely bad wedding dresses. On your wedding day, does your bosom need to be exposed to everyone? How does one even hug the bride when she's wearing this? It seems that someone told the bride to "show off her best features" on her wedding day, and she took it literally.</p><h3>6. Balloon wedding dress</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/e5e5140cb727d8a2.jpg><p class=align-left>What can make a wedding more special for the bride than putting on a wedding gown made out of balloons? You have to give this bride props for creativity. The design is there, but the balloons ruin everything. If you go for this look on your wedding day, ensure that you do not come into contact with pointy objects.</p><h3>7. Lady Mary Charteris wedding dress</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/49e954fa5031380c.jpg><p class=align-left>Lady Mary Charteris wore one of the most scandalous wedding dresses on her big day. If you belong to British royalty, your wedding dress should be classic and elegant, but Lady Mary decided to shock her guests. She wore the eye-catching gown, complete with a tulle skirt and floral headpiece, as she tied the knot to rock <a href=#>musician</a> Robbie Furze.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/20dad97b640b813c.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Beautiful African wedding dresses for guests</span></p></a><h3>8. Bride or stripper?</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/0817f958f8add408.jpg><p class=align-left>This is one of the most horrible wedding dresses. Having something so revealing isn’t something a bride should wear on her big day. This bride looked like she was going to a stripping club instead of her own wedding.</p><h3>9. Cocoon-inspired wedding gown</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/b2d197338bdaa9cc.jpg><p class=align-left>This is one of the tackiest wedding dresses. While non-traditional dresses are usually cool, there is no market for something as extravagant as this. Russian nesting dolls inspired this 1965 wedding dress. For any woman who's ever wanted to look like a crocheted hot dog on their wedding day, this look is for you.</p><h3>10. Emma Thompson wedding dress</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/78678e5bbdd4cac2.jpg><p class=align-left>Who, on earth, told Emma Thompson that she looked great before leaving the house on the morning of her wedding? Emma chose an unusual wedding dress with a skirt, suspiciously similar to the wallpaper. The puffy sleeves and the fabric, which resembles dated upholstery, combined with the bizarre cut of the outfit sadly make this dress an epic fail.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/5ad39ed600291716.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Nyashinski traditional wedding: New photos from the event</span></p></a><h3>11. A jumpsuit for a wedding gown?</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/20dad97b640b813c.jpg><p class=align-left>Always the trendsetter, Solange Knowles is never one to stay within the constraints of conventional beauty or fashion, always marching to the beat of her drum when it comes to her art and personal style. It's no surprise that Knowles opted for a beige-coloured jumpsuit while biking around New Orleans with her husband, director Alan Ferguson., on her big day.</p><h3>12. Mama June's hot mess</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/bacccff4b60dc207.jpg><p class=align-left>Mama June isn't known for being an elegant woman. She wore a camo wedding dress. The worst part of her choice of wedding down was the "colour" choices. Her overly ruched skirt and vile contrasting orange sash left fans shaking heads in disbelief. Combine that with the matching groom, and you have one of the worst wedding outfit combos ever seen.</p><h3>13. Tina Turner wedding gown</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/c48494b23c096444.jpg><p class=align-left>What is this dress? Tina Turner can do better. The green poofy gown looked like something that might appear in the play Wicked. Besides, the colour wasn’t flattering, and the leggings that appeared in the front ruined everything.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/aab8895c2127c21c.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Bridal shower gifts that the bride will definitely love</span></p></a><h3>14. Queen of exaggeration</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/68fb82637626fab8.jpg><p class=align-left>This dress looks so impractical. The bride created a dress that is at least nine feet wide. You are left to wonder if the bride made it to the aisle. She probably waddled down the aisle or opted for an outdoor wedding. This was exaggeration at its worst.</p><h3>15. Cream puffs wedding gown</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/5ad39ed600291716.jpg><p class=align-left>While wedding cakes are undoubtedly awesome, you probably wouldn't want to wear one. This is a 20-pound dress made from cream puffs. You are left wondering what will be leftover for this dress after everyone picks off the cream puffs.</p><p class=align-left>There you have it. A comprehensive list of the worst wedding dresses of all time with pictures. Choosing the right wedding dress may or may not be one of the most important considerations you make about your wedding day. If it isn't, perhaps it ought to be, because the wrong dress can go as far as to ruin your whole wedding!</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/f63df7e6aeaa46ce.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Best kitenge dress designs for weddings in Kenya 2020</span></p></a><p class=align-left><a href=#>Tuko.co.ke </a>published an article about the <a href=#>best wedding gowns </a>in Kenya and their prices 2020.
