She joined Harper’s Bazaar as an assistant to legendary editor Diana Vreeland in 1950. The role sparked a lifelong interest in fashion and she soon became famous for her impeccable wardrobe and A-list friends, including Andy Warhol and Truman Capote.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"She was the height of elegance, a true icon," Mathilde Favier, Christian Dior's public relations director, told WWD. The pair were close friends and Radziwill reportedly introduced Favier to her husband. "[She was] an incredibly attractive woman who always adapted to whatever the circumstance. She was never overdressed or underdressed...She was incredibly elegant and inspiring, and always ahead of her time because she was a fashion visionary. It’s very sad. It’s the end of an era."</p><img alt="Lee Radziwill" title="Lee Radziwill" width=2532 height=3887 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/princess-lee-radziwill-in-london-with-her-sister-jacqueline-news-photo-3232461-1550404117.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">William Lovelace</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Radziwill was born Caroline Lee Bouvier in 1933, four years after her sister, to stockbroker John Vernou Bouvier III and socialite Janet Lee Bouvier. She soared to fashion stardom when Jackie married John F. Kennedy and became First Lady of the United States.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The sisters were one of the most famous and highly photographed duos during the 1960s. During this time, Radziwill worked briefly as an actress before becoming a successful interior designer as well as brand ambassador and public relations executive for Giorgio Armani.</p><img alt="Giorgio Armani Prive : Backstage - Paris Fashion Week - Haute Couture Fall/Winter 2015/2016" title="Giorgio Armani Prive : Backstage - Paris Fashion Week - Haute Couture Fall/Winter 2015/2016" width=2000 height=3000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/princess-lee-radziwill-and-giorgio-armani-pose-backstage-news-photo-479811662-1550404207.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Bertrand Rindoff Petroff</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The Italian designer told <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://wwd.com/eye/people/lee-radziwill-dies-at-1203029195/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=WWD class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">WWD</a> that Radziwill was extremely elegant. "When I met her in the early '80s, I had the impression that she represented a very contemporary irony about American aristocracy, which is almost impossible to define. It is one that combined ease and sophistication, spontaneity and respect for the rules."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Radziwill was married three times during her life. She first wed Michael Canfield, a publishing executive and the couple lived in London before the marriage was annulled five years later.
