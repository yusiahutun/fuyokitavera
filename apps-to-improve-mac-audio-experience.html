However, these built-in options may not suffice for audio enthusiasts, let alone professional users. It's also true that macOS lacks some audio utilities, like a system-wide equalizer and in-app volume control.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fortunately, you can use third-party apps to enhance the audio quality with the help of equalizers and customization options. Here are five apps that can help you improve your audio experience on a Mac.</p><h2 id=background-music>1. Background Music</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/background-music-for-mac.jpg><p>As we said, macOS does not offer in-app volume controls. Therefore, while you can control the volume within the Music or TV app, you cannot control the volume of a web browser or a video calling app. This could be a problem if you want to increase the volume of a quiet app or vice versa.</p><p>Background Music solves this problem by allowing you to control the volume level for each application. You can also choose between multiple output devices. The app also offers an auto-pause feature, which automatically pauses the audio from an app when you open another app.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Finally, because Background Music creates a virtual audio device, it can be used to record system audio. This feature can be useful if you <a href=#>use a Mac to create podcasts</a>. We also find it convenient that installing Background Music does not require a restart. In short, this free audio control app is a great option for advanced Mac users.</p><p><strong>Download</strong>: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Background Music</a> (Free)</p><h2 id=boom3d>2. Boom3D</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/boom3d-for-mac.jpg><p>Many Mac users believe the native audio output is often flat and boring. Although macOS allows you to <a href=#>use an equalizer for the Apple Music app</a>, it does not make much of a difference. Boom3D combines virtual audio technology and an equalizer to improve the overall volume and quality of the sound output from your Mac.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It works by routing macOS audio through a virtual 3D surround system. This system not only amplifies the volume levels but also brings features like surround sound and spatial cues. You can use the app to enhance your movie-watching, music, or gaming experience on a Mac.</p><p>Boom3D also offers other features, such as in-app volume control, a hi-res audio player, and a variety of equalizer presets. However, you need to restart your Mac while installing and setting up Boom3D.</p><p><strong>Download</strong>: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Boom3D</a> ($24.99, free trial available)</p><h2 id=eqmac>3. eqMac</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/eqmac-for-mac.jpg><p>The equalizer utility in macOS only works within the Music app, which means the audio output from other apps can be flat. So, consider using eqMac, a system audio equalizer and volume mixer app, to eliminate this limitation.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The free version of eqMac offers basic equalizer settings for your Mac. For instance, you can adjust the bass, mids, and highs. The 10-band gain control equalizer is also an excellent way to adjust the output according to the context. The hundreds of headphone presets are also helpful.</p><p>If you deal with multiple input devices, the intuitive UI of eqMac will be a boon. We also appreciate that the developer takes feedback very seriously and adds new features based on user demand.</p><p><strong>Download</strong>: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">eqMac</a> (Free, subscription available)</p><h2 id=vox-music-player>4. Vox Music Player</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/vox-audio-player-for-mac.jpg><p>If you are an audiophile, you may also need a hi-res audio player on your Mac. Since Apple's Music app does not perform well in this area, you'll have to rely on a third-party hi-res audio player like Vox Music Player.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Vox Music Player for Mac supports hi-res music from various sources. To get started, you can use <a href=#>hi-res audio formats</a> such as FLAC, M4A, APE, PCM, and ALAC. You can also stream audio from platforms such as SoundCloud and YouTube.</p><p>We also like how customizable Vox Music Player is; for example, you can choose from different equalizer patterns and other preferences.</p><p><strong>Download</strong>: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Vox Music Player</a> (Free, subscription available)</p><h2 id=optimize-your-mac-for-audio>Optimize Your Mac for Audio</h2><p>As you have seen, these apps can improve the overall audio experience on your Mac. While not everyone needs all these apps, you would find at least one or two of them helpful.</p><p>That said, we don't think the built-in Music app is a lost cause. In fact, you can make the best out of Apple's lossless music player by resolving common issues and optimizing it for your needs.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3KnqysnZ%2Bbe6S7zGiYqaijYsGwecimp6unppp6rq3CZpiunJmkeqbEz56pop2emLJw</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
