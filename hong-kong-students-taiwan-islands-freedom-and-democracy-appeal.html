The government suspended the bill, but protesters have continued to call for its full withdrawal and an independent investigation into the use of force by police.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2019/07/24/41dc92c2-aa2e-11e9-862b-600d112f3b14_1320x770_161534.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Cheung was one of dozens of Hong Kong students in Taiwan who showed their support for the protesters outside the presidential office in Taipei last month, calling on the island’s leader, Tsai Ing-wen, to help those seeking asylum.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I can’t imagine what it will be like if this bill is revived and passed,” he said, claiming that Beijing could easily use it to detain people for speaking out against it.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Taiwan is the place of choice for many Hong Kong people, given its free and democratic environment. And since the government has offered strong support for the anti-extradition bill campaign, I hope it can reach out to these people and lend them a helping hand,” he said.</p>Tsai has acknowledged that Hong Kong protesters have fled to Taiwan and said the government would consider any applications to seek shelter there <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">“on humanitarian grounds”</span></a>, according to Taiwan’s Central News Agency.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Cheung, a first-year student, said staying in Taiwan was also an option for him after he graduated.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“But I still want to go back to Hong Kong after graduation, to do something for my fellow citizens and do all I can to maintain the freedom and democracy there,” said Cheung, who was one of more than 80 people arrested and charged with “obstructing public servants in the course of their duty” when the final Occupy Central pro-democracy protesters were cleared from Mong Kok in 2014.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Hong Kong leader’s advisers dismiss idea of amnesty for all protesters</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Another Hong Kong student in Taipei, Ho Wing-tung, 22, who set up Hong Kong Outlanders, a group supporting the anti-extradition protesters, said she was pessimistic about the city’s future.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Even if we succeed in blocking the bill, there will be a second, third and fourth draconian bill to replace it sooner or later,” said Ho, who is in the final year of a philosophy degree at Chinese Culture University.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Since the one country, two systems model has been applied in Hong Kong, the mainland authorities have gradually changed what they want to change to obstruct a free and democratic system in the city,” she said. “Where is the so-called autonomy the Chinese government promised?”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Ho added that Taiwanese should not believe that the model would be good for them.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Many Hong Kong people aged between 20 and 30 believe that the city would be better off being free from mainland control,” she said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Ho said living permanently in Taiwan was an option for her, but she also expected Beijing would try to erode the city’s freedoms and she wanted to do something for Hong Kong by going back and voicing her opposition.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Lin Fei-fan, 31, who was a leader of the Sunflower student movement in Taiwan in 2014 that blocked a sweeping trade deal with the mainland, said many civic groups and the Taiwanese government supported the campaign against the extradition bill in Hong Kong, and they were watching the situation closely.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Taiwan doesn’t have refugee legislation, but for those who need help from the government they can use the Act Governing Relations with Hong Kong and Macau,” Lin said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Under the act, assistance is to be provided to residents of the two cities if their safety and liberty are immediately threatened for political reasons.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Lin said the Hong Kong protesters should be able to stay in Taiwan if they met certain requirements.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">There are nearly 9,000 students from Hong Kong in Taiwan at present.
