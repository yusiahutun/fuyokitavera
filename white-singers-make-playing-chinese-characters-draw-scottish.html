Classic #yellowface. 3) has this production received any taxpayer funding? 4) why does this continue, especially on stage?”</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Slant-eyed masks, ‘Wuhan girls’ chant: outrage at Paris dinner party</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The Glasgow company responded: “We are deeply sorry for the offence caused by the casting of our 2020 production of John Adam’s Nixon in China. [ …] We are also sorry for any misrepresentation caused by the stage make-up. For example, we intended to portray the character of Chairman Mao as old and in ill-health, and in no way were we trying to change his ethnicity.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The statement failed to calm things down. Advocacy organisation Beats, founded by British East and Southeast Asians in theatre and the screen industry, said on June 11 that Scottish Opera’s claim about the part of Mao was misleading.</p>“There is clear photographic evidence that the practice of yellowface was employed on dancers in the production – the application of make-up on white performers to make them look more East Asian.

Opera is a traditionally white-dominated world, so casting qualified minority actors is a plus for representation and we support that.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“On the other hand, east Asians have been excluded from opera, which has a long history of Orientalism and yellowface performance and casting.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Change is possible. Last year, the English National Opera agreed to ditch yellowface make-up in an all-white production of Madama Butterfly. Meanwhile, the South Bank Show Awards Panel said it stands by its decision to nominate Nixon in China for the&nbsp;2021 award.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The debate over racial representation in operas, coming at a time when the country is embroiled in a broader culture war and there is growing racism and violence directed at East and Southeast Asians, is not likely to dissipate any time soon.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuaqyxKyrsqSVZK6zwNJmmq6kpKq%2FpnvAq6uim5yafHR9knBtaWhfrLWqwMRmqqKml5q%2FtHnMmqKeZaChrrq1zaBknKCZo7K0sYycn5qqkZjBpr7SZpurmadiwKS7062grKA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
