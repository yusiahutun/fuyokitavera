assessment of the school and it's camp.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>He recommended the school cease holding the camps at the height of summer and condemned it for making students hike over long distances carrying packs in blistering heat.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The coroner also recommended the school adopt better guidelines for heat stress management, including limiting strenuous activity to 60 minutes per session when the temperature is between 31 to 35 degrees and postponing activities when the temperature exceeds 36 degrees.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Maurice Blackburn lawyers allege Huntingtower&nbsp;owed Alexander's parents a duty to exercise reasonable care and skill in the&nbsp;running of the camp and its care of their son.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'The defendant was negligent in its running of the camp such that the&nbsp;deceased died and the plaintiffs’ suffered injury,' it stated.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>It is claimed the school broke it's own risk management plan for the&nbsp;Plumbago Expedition for the&nbsp;limitation of physical activity in the 'heat of the day'.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'The staff did not check the temperature at all on the said&nbsp;date and did not know what temperatures the deceased&nbsp;would be walking in and therefore how to apply the Huntingtower Risk Management Plan for the Plumbago&nbsp;Expedition,' lawyers stated.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>According to the statement of claim, it is further alleged the school failed to consider Alexander's fitness and health properly before&nbsp;instructing him to walk with a loaded pack and carrying water in&nbsp;temperatures which exceeded 35C and failed to provide sufficient time for him to acclimatise&nbsp;to the conditions at the station before commencing the hike.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Huntingtower principal Sholto Bowen was on a school camp in Indonesia and
