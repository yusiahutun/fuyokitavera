While <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>eye creams</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>serums</a> can help diminish their appearance over time, the <strong>best color correctors for dark circles</strong> instantly brighten and conceal problem areas within seconds. How exactly? As professional makeup artist <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=4 rel=nocaes>Cat Mignano</a> explains: “Color correction in makeup revolves around understanding <strong>color theory</strong>, she says. “If you look at the color wheel, you'll find that correcting involves using colors opposite to the ones you're trying to balance.”&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We found oodles of options to choose from, including <strong>palettes</strong> that allow you to blend multiple colors, <strong>pots</strong> with illuminating <strong>cream</strong> and <strong>powder</strong> potions, and sharp, pointed <strong>crayons</strong> that wipe out deep creases. However, our team of editors huddled together before we <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>individually tested</a> 21 of the most promising color correctors based on expert insight and buzzy reviews. Each of us, with different skin types and tones, evaluated the color corrector based on whether it washed over our skin with <strong>even lightweight coverage</strong>, noting if the formula felt <strong>creamy</strong> and <strong>blendable</strong> and if its applicator made the process seamless. And, of course, we judged its final look and whether the color corrector was truly <strong>pigmented</strong> enough to conceal or significantly reduce the appearance of dark circles completely.&nbsp;<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-stila-correct-and-perfect-all-in-one-color-correcting-palette></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Overall</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Stila Correct And Perfect All In One Color Correcting Palette</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Stila Correct And Perfect All In One Color Correcting Palette" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/oOuJKFIXt2JyS3odHPYL8TT0CJo=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Stila-Correct--Perfect-All-in-One-Color-Correcting-Palette-7991d340344c43c8a01b592ec6d0b76a.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Nordstrom</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>This moisturizing formula feels weightless but covers dark circles (plus, redness and shine!) flawlessly.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>This multi-shade palette offers more than just under-eye coverage.

Despite providing full coverage and completely covering our dark circles and rosacea-induced redness around our cheeks, it felt so smooth and moisturizing, like we didn’t have a stitch of makeup on our face.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We appreciate the handy infographic that showcases where to use each of the <strong>seven colors</strong>, and, as a bonus, the palette also includes two tinted finishing powders for when you’re ready to set your face and say goodbye to shine for the entire day.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Type</strong>: Cream, powder | <strong>Shades:</strong> 7 colors per palette | <strong>Key Ingredients:</strong> Vitamins A, C, and E | <strong>Finish</strong>: Natural | <strong>Size:</strong> 0.46 oz</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-drugstore-catrice-cosmetics-under-eye-brightener></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Drugstore</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Catrice Cosmetics Under Eye Brightener</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Catrice Cosmetics Under Eye Brightener" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/bzzyxEKGx1aZyIFvalGqlz1JqyU=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/catrice-cosmetics-under-eye-brightener-cd1361b403ea48308f0ff4de59d090a0.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> You can pat this secret weapon on right over makeup and immediately perk up tired eyes.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>There’s a limited shade range.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Who knew that this little pink pot of goodness could have so much potential? Seemingly unassuming in size and price, the under-eye brighter boasted <strong>impressive results, bringing our </strong>vampire-esque under-eyes back to the land of the living. The <strong>pink undertones complemented our baby blues </strong>so they had a slight twinkle with a much <strong>brighter</strong> all-over appearance.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The cream corrector also had a similar effect on our makeup and skin that re-setting spray might: It perked up creasing concealer and plumped out our skin with its lighter-as-a-feather<strong> formula</strong>. Infused with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>hyaluronic acid</a> and shea butter, the formula <strong>doesn’t sink into creases</strong> and fine lines, nor will it pill around flakey skin —&nbsp;a pro-pick to have on hand during arid, cool months. Plus, the <strong>velvety cream consistency</strong> was one of the silkiest, lightest feeling options we tried (Making it seem much more expensive than it really was.) Since we’re such huge fans we wish the shade range had a few more options, but on the flip side the light rose colorway is nearly translucent and promises to be a universally flattering shade.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Type</strong>: Cream | <strong>Shades</strong>: 2 | <strong>Key Ingredients</strong>: Shea butter, hyaluronic acid | <strong>Finish</strong>: Radiant | <strong>Size</strong>: 0.15 oz</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-brightening-smashbox-becca-under-eye-brightening-corrector></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Brightening</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Smashbox Under Eye Corrector</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Smashbox Becca Under Eye Brightening Corrector" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/lha4tngMG89_w6Kz1gFU3rBCV9k=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Smashbox-Becca-Under-Eye-Brightening-Corrector-b900855486df4849836eef92b4f848b7.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Smashbox</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>This color corrector evens out discoloration and has an illuminating effect.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> It has a bit of shimmer in it, which may not be for everyone.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you're looking for a product that will <strong>brighten</strong> your under-eye area while simultaneously covering dark circles, there’s nothing better than this <strong>illuminating corrector</strong>.&nbsp;The color corrector's tint <strong>cancels out the dark blue and purple hues</strong> of dark circles, while the <strong>backlight technology makes skin appear radiant</strong>. It is also formulated with<strong> <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>vitamin E</a></strong> to keep your under-eyes hydrated and moisturized, which helps prevent makeup from cracking or creasing.

The yellow shade worked wonders at <strong>neutralizing redness</strong>, particularly around the out corners of our under-eyes, while the <strong>subtle radiant finish</strong> averted attention away from shadowy bags.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We wore it alone for a <strong>luminous, even-toned</strong> appearance on our no-makeup days, often reaching for the <strong>pocket-sized palette</strong> for a midday refresher, and used it to <strong>set our concealer for all-day staying power</strong>, too. Although the powder dusted on breezily without catching over dry spots or sinking into deep creases, the application is definitely more finger-friendly because picking it up with a brush proved a little tricky (it didn’t want to stick to the bristles).&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Type: </strong>Powder | <strong>Shades:</strong> 4<strong> </strong>| <strong>Key Ingredients: </strong>Corn starch, coconut oil, glycerin<strong> </strong>| <strong>Finish: </strong>Radiant | <strong>Size: </strong>0.14 oz</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-liquid-exa-high-fidelity-balancing-color-corrector></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Liquid</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>EXA High Fidelity Color Corrector</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="EXA High Fidelity Balancing Color Corrector" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/LBHokLqdMZK3q3_pki5MNUJOR7U=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/exa-high-fidelity-balancing-color-corrector-da2c1dbb84e144358540967dd107773c.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>EXA</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The convenient tube packaging and doe foot applicator make for easy use.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>This product isn’t crease-proof.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Even after going viral on TikTok a few seasons ago, we can say we still love this <strong>sensitive skin-safe </strong>liquid formula that boasts <strong>clean ingredients</strong> and <strong>impeccable blendability</strong>.

It's specially formulated with <strong>carnauba wax</strong>, which prevents creasing, as well as <strong>flavonoids, soothing antioxidants,</strong> to help reduce the appearance of puffiness. To top it all off, the formula also boasts mica for a <strong>glowy, illuminating effect</strong> — lightweight and buildable with a natural finish, you'll only need to blend a dab of concealer over top, but you may want to layer it over a primer to ensure lasting power.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Type</strong>: Cream | <strong>Shades:</strong> 4 | <strong>Key Ingredients</strong>: Bentonite clay, mica, vitamin E | <strong>Finish</strong>: Natural | <strong>Size:</strong> 0.09 oz</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-dark-skin-tones-live-tinted-huestick-corrector></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Dark Skin Tones</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Live Tinted Huestick Corrector</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Live Tinted Huestick Corrector" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/XWBQtCJwJMW2Q3uOyKl7Cd8tB90=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Live-Tinted-Huestick-Corrector-17b13e95a7484eecba3883f689331df8.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Credo</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>This color corrector comes in packaging similar to an oversized crayon, making it super easy to use.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>Though this all-in-one stick provides excellent coverage for dark circles and redness, it’s less successful in concealing veins or blue/green tones.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This <strong>multi-use crayon </strong>is ideal for quick touch-ups and life on the go. Its <strong>chubby</strong> <strong>pencil-like packaging</strong> and <strong>creamy consistency</strong> make it convenient to throw in a bag and <strong>easy to apply </strong>no matter where you are. Even though it’s creamy, it <strong>set fairly quickly</strong>, went on smoothly, and <strong>didn’t sink into deep creases</strong>.

It's the South Asian-founded brand's hero product and it's available in <strong>five distinct shades</strong> to complement a diverse range of skin tones.

Not only was it easy to layer, providing us with <strong>full coverage</strong>, but the unique <strong>squeeze bottle</strong> allowed for a <strong>smooth, precise application</strong>.

What’s more, the <strong>lightweight formula</strong> helped spread the color evenly without any smudging or pilling.&nbsp;Although it initially has a very hydrating, dewy finish, it becomes less prominent as it dries down.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-43 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Type: </strong>Liquid | <strong>Shades:</strong> 7 | <strong>Key Ingredients:</strong> Chamomile flower extract, cucumber fruit extract | <strong>Finish: </strong>Natural | <strong>Size:</strong> 0.4 oz</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-mature-skin-bobbi-brown-under-eye-corrector></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Mature Skin</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Bobbi Brown Under Eye Corrector</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Bobbi Brown Under Eye Corrector" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/fQpGBvt397DZ-NNLbTPGXjpW7Fo=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Bobbi-Brown-Under-Eye-Corrector-3701fac752b54787b6756a8f2b8d1919.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>It comes in a ton of shades and is totally budge-proof.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>It doesn’t come with an applicator.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-47 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This Bobbi Brown <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>dark circle erasing </a>concealer is a very popular option and for good reason: Not only is the cream corrector infused with <strong>moisturizing ingredients</strong>, notably <strong>vitamin E </strong>and kaolin clay, to keep your under-eye area looking smooth and hydrated, but it's also <strong>waterproof</strong>, <strong>sweatproof</strong>, and <strong>humidity-resistant</strong>, so it will stay put all day.

At first glance, we thought the palette might be too powdery, but it actually uses a <strong>signature blend of powders, oils, and pigments</strong> all blended together to create one <strong>very</strong> <strong>luscious cream </strong>texture and <strong>easy-to-apply formula</strong>. There was <strong>no smudging</strong> or creasing at all after we applied it to our under-eyes.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-54 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We noticed an <strong>instant difference</strong> in the intensity and tone of our dark circles. As we dabbed the <strong>ultra-pigmented formula</strong> from the inner corner of our eye outward, our shadowy under-eye area began to <strong>soften and even out</strong> with a <strong>natural finish</strong>. In particular, the <strong>peach and yellow tones</strong> in the palette helped to hide the ashy look of our dehydrated skin. Although we didn't need to layer too much in order to get a great result, the formula is <strong>buildable</strong> if you want extra coverage or a touch-up later in the day.<strong> </strong>While we love the hybrid formula, it can feel slick on some skin types — particularly if you have oily skin.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-55 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Type:</strong> Cream<strong> | Shades:</strong> 4 colors per palette; 4 palette colorways | <strong>Key Ingredients: </strong>Vitamin E, evodia rutaecarpa fruit extract | <strong>Finish: </strong>Natural<strong> </strong>| <strong>Size:</strong> 0.23 oz<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-to-keep-in-mind></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What to Keep in Mind</span></h2><ul id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html" readability=7.9581351094196><li readability=6><strong>Shade</strong>: Color correctors are as simple as understanding the basic principles of the color wheel. “Green is used to neutralize red, making it great for covering up acne flare-ups, sunburns, and rosacea,” says La Banco. “Yellow is a super versatile concealer color that brightens sallowness. It cancels out purple tones, like veins or bruises, while still neutralizing mild to moderate redness.” Mignano agrees, adding that if you want to tackle several tones and intensities at once, yellow is your answer and it works especially well on olive and medium skin tones, she says.<p>Dark circles tend to appear as flashes of blues and purples, and these tones tend to be particularly intense on deeper skin tones, says Mignano, meaning that warm reds, pinks, and oranges help fade under-eye darkness.</p></li><li readability=3><strong>Coverage</strong>: You can count on liquid or cream formulas to deliver strong coverage with a natural, hydrated finish with fewer swipes of product. In some cases, they may allow you to skip concealer or foundation altogether, but this will vary from person to person, depending on personal preference and desired coverage.<p>Powders won’t totally transform the darkest under-eyes into a bright, well-rested appearance, but they are fantastic for layering on top of creams or liquids to lock your makeup in place so it lasts all day. Mignano opts for a slightly peachy-toned powder to add extra brightness under the eyes.</p></li><li readability=3.9361393323657><strong>Finish</strong>: Color correctors come in a variety of formulas and finishes. For a hydrated, dewy look, liquids are your best bet, while powders will provide a totally matte base. For something in the middle, go with a cream, although you’ll want to swatch several different formulas on your hand before purchasing, as some can be quite silky, while others lean more dry and matte.<p>But there’s one non-negotiable feature that every color corrector should have, according to celebrity makeup artist <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>Lisa Aharon</a>. “I almost always choose something with some brightening or radiance,” she says. “It not only covers but also helps reflect light and draw less attention to the darker area.”&nbsp;<br></p></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-your-questions-answered></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Your Questions, Answered</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>What is the best shade to cover dark circles?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Remember, think back to the color wheel — you’ll want to use complimentary colors to conceal the problem area. “So, purple is for correcting sallowness, orange can be used for blue tones, pink for brightening, and green for red tones,” says Aharon. She explains that light skin tones will likely use a peach tone versus orange, and darker skin tones will use a red versus a pink tone.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>How do you use a color corrector for dark circles?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">To begin, Mignano recommends prepping the under-eye with a moisturizing eye cream to prevent texture and creasing. Then, “I like to use the warmth of my fingers to apply and press intentionally into only the area of the under-eye with discoloration,” she says. Next, whether you apply the color corrector with your fingers, sponge, or brush, Aharon says you should continue to pat and build until you’ve covered the area. “There’s no need to let anything dry, although I do like to leave a moment between any layer of building color or product on the face, just to let it set in,” she adds.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">However, Aharon notes that unless you’re using a shade for brightening, concealer and foundation always go on top of the color corrector to camouflage the green, orange, purple, or yellow tones.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>What does a color corrector do?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Essentially, a color corrector is similar to a primer in that it sits under makeup to prep the skin for more product. It neutralizes unwanted tones, like dark circles or redness, so that your concealer doesn't have to do as much work. Color correctors are a great step to add to your makeup routine if you struggle with complexion concerns, such as dark under-eye circles, redness, dullness, or hyperpigmentation. They also provide a good base for the rest of your makeup, hydrating your skin and illuminating your under-eyes.&nbsp;<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-why-shop-with-us></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Why Shop With Us</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Irene Richardson</a> is a fashion and beauty writer for InStyle’s commerce team.
