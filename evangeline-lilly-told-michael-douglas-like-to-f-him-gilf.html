"And we were in a waiting room, so they filmed the waiting room with extras and there were children."</p><p>"I turned to Michael and Michelle and I said, 'You know, you guys are real GILFs,'" she added.</p><p>The "Lost" alum said Douglas, 78, had "no idea" what "GILF" meant.</p><p>"He said, 'What's a GILF?' Instead of being cool about it, in front of a room full of children I went, 'It's a grandpa I'd like to f---,'" Lilly recalled. "And then [I] immediately realized I'd told Michael Douglas I'd like to f--- him, which is not what you should say in front of a bunch of kids, oops!"</p><p>Unfortunately, "The Hobbit" star didn't reveal what happened next, including how Douglas and Pfeiffer reacted. However, Lilly opened up about her experience working with the veteran actors.</p><p>"I got to be in a scene with the three of them on my 42nd birthday," she recalled. "They're so cool. You don't want to meet your icons because you're afraid they're going to disappoint and the three of them are cooler than you think they are. They're amazing."</p><p>Douglas -- who has been married to <a href=#>Catherine Zeta-Jones</a> since 2000 -- has two grandchildren. His son, Cameron Douglas, from Douglas' previous marriage to Diandra Luker, has a 5-year-old daughter, and a 2-year-old son. Pfeiffer, meanwhile, is married to David E. Kelly, with whom she had two adult children. It's unclear whether or not the couple has any grandchildren.</p><a id=gallery-link-68ce72a0-8707-491c-8f4c-fe029e473376 class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:68ce72a0-8707-491c-8f4c-fe029e473376 data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:e7f7cdfb-f70f-417a-b532-971b92087984 data-gallery-layout=carousel><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/13/4by3/2023/02/07/13df966aada74792a593e57c33c85ed6_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3R7j2tma2xfmsOiusaeo6KmlWK5qrjLsmStp5yZeq61wqGYnqRdmby2s8uaqmakmaCybsDOZp1moJmieqi1y59m</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
