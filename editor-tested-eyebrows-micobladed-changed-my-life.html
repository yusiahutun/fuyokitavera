I was born with full brows, but in a particularly dark moment in the seventh grade, I snuck into my mother’s bathroom, stole her tweezers, and plucked them into a super thin, almost non-existent line.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">My friends didn’t blink—it was 2002, after all—but my mother was horrified when she saw them, and told me I would regret it. True to my mother’s prophesy, my brows have never been the same—ever. I’ve been filling them in for years, and although they looked fine, they looked, well, filled in.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">I resigned myself to my penciling-in fate long ago. But, 5 months ago, I discovered a solution to my eyebrow woes: Microblading, which is a semi-permanent tattoo. The procedure uses super tiny needles to draw on small strokes by hand, which mimic the appearance of individual strands of hair.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>VIDEO: 10 Brow Kits to Perfect Your Arches</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">We’ve all <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>read the guides</a>, but the experience of getting it done is, unsurprisingly, much different. I went to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>Piret</a> <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3>Aava</a>’s office, A.K.A. the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=4>Eyebrow Doctor</a>. I’d stalked her Instagram and a fellow InStyle staffer vouched for her skills, so I knew my brows were in good hands.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Piret started by using eyeliner to draw the shape, which I requested—multiple times thanks to nerves—be “super natural.” After you approve the shape, she mixes a custom color for you (mine was called “chocolate truffle”). She then shows you the needle, which is a small pen-like object that’s actually made up of many other little needles, similar to those used for acupuncture.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>BEFORE:</strong></p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Kyleen James</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Before Piret began the procedure, she loaded my brow region up with numbing cream, and then handed me two stress balls to hold. It was only then that I thought: Oh shit, is this going to hurt? The stress balls, clearly ineffective, gave way to a mini panic about what was going to happen: A stranger is going to tattoo my face. Tattoo. My. Face.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">I’m a sensible gal; <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Piret</a> wouldn’t have a one-year wait list if she weren’t the best in the business. After internally rattling off her credentials, I calmed down and let her do her thing.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The whole procedure lasted roughly an hour and a half; the initial shaping outline took 35 minutes, and the actual microblading took another 40. When she was finished, she measured them to make sure they were even, and just like that, my eyebrows were perfect.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The number one question I got after was “Did it hurt?” In a word: Yes. While the procedure wasn’t extremely painful, there’s definite discomfort. For me, however, the sound was actually worse than the pain. Since your eyebrows are in close proximity to your ears, each stroke was accompanied by a crystal-clear scraping sound.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While the procedure was swift, the aftercare lasts over a week. Piret gave me strict instructions, explaining that I must keep my brows dry for seven days—avoiding water and sweat-inducing activities—and religiously apply Vaseline, like a regular tattoo. My brows peeled slightly the second week post-blading, making Piret’s stern no-picking warning all the more difficult to follow.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>AFTER:</strong></p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_28-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Everyone reacts differently to the dye, so 30 days after your initial visit, you return for a quick 40-minute touch-up to fill further define or darken brows. After that, you have perfect brows for one to three years.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_35-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Without exaggeration, microblading has changed my life. I save so much time in the morning not filling my eyebrows in, and when I go makeup free, I still feel put together. The shape enhanced my eyes and subtly changed my face—close friends ask what I did and why I look so good, and coworkers stop me in the halls to compliment my brows.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_37-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Although it’s an expensive procedure ($1,500 plus tax), it’s worth every penny. My brows have never looked better—even before great plucking incident of seventh grade. Even my mom agrees!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57wZ6YrqypZLKltdOoqWaslajBprCMnrCemqKkxLR5zKKaqJqclrGmsIycn5qml5qxbrnYZqOinpU%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
