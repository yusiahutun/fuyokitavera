"So I just wanted to stress that to her, and she said, 'We're good. We're good.' And I moved on."</p><h2 class=h2>On Phaedra Parks' "RHOA" accusation that Kandi Burruss had schemed to drug Porsha Williams and take her home:</h2><p>"I think she's sneaky and I think she's gotta be on something to just have no expression and no emotion. She's just like not there, I felt like."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:b2158b2f-4c22-51d0-b4ea-771d21c81bfd data-container-ref=toofab:article:7dd61c51-731a-5429-a830-3848f01939d0 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/0e/5by4/2017/05/01/0e0294ee43885360a13c1b2d82597370_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><h4 class=article-block__card-title>NeNe Leakes Blasts 'Real Housewives of Atlanta' Co-Stars Over Kandi Burruss Date Rape Accusation (Video)</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><h2 class=h2>On her feud with Kenya at Sheree Whitfield's housewarming</h2><p>"I know she's kind of like a lunatic, so I wasn't overly surprised, but she was just being rude. I'm pretty possessive of my friends, and Sheree and I are pretty close, so no. But it was low blows. Don't mess with my man, my money or my kids. You started with all that."</p><h2 class=h2>On her relationship with Kandi Burruss</h2><p>"Kandi's a Taurus - She's May 17th, I'm May 19th, so we're pretty close. I get her. It's been five years. We had a pretty good friendship. And I'm irritated that she never cleared up the fact that I didn't steal Kash's name and that she was OK on 'Don't Be Tardy' and paid well, you know? So I just wanted to stress that to her, and she said, 'We're good. We're good.' And I moved on. Kandi is not a bad person. What you see is what you get pretty much with her."</p><p>"I know she's been with women in the past and that sort of thing, and I've also hear about her in her marriage with somebody else, which would never happen in mine, but I don't know her and I'm not close to her to even answer that.

He's going great. He actually has perfect vision in both eyes, which is all we care about. The rest we can fix."</p><p>"He was just, unfortunately, bit by a dog, but he's an animal lover, like, I can see him being a vet at some point - that's how much he loves dogs, cats..."</p><p>"I'm not able to discuss [specifics on the owner of the dog].
