He scored in the German Cup championship match in 2020 against Bayer Leverkusen.</p><h2><span id=A_Cross-Cultural_Union>A Cross-Cultural Union</span></h2><p>From the Ivory Coast, which is in South Africa, came Jean-Hermann. He went to Germany to learn the language so he could teach there when he got back.</p><p>Jean-Hermann left because he knew he was intended for something bigger. He fell in love with Birgit, his soul match. He fell in love with Birgit after meeting her. After ultimately getting hitched, they relocated. They received their only son, Serge, who was of mixed race, on July 14, 1995.</p><h2><span id=His_son8217s_career_was_affected_by_Hermann>His son’s career was affected by Hermann</span></h2><p>Jean influenced his son’s football career despite not being a professional player.

He never left his side during his trying times and motivated him to work even harder.</p><h2><span id=He_is_wed_to_a_dependable_wife>He is wed to a dependable wife</span></h2><p>Jean is fortunate to have a wife who supports keeping one’s feet on the ground. Her son Serge, who was nurtured in like manner, has inherited his mother’s disposition. Serge once recalled his mother saying, “Serge, this can’t go on forever,” during an interview.</p><p>You are not required to spend money in this way. You must maintain your composure because everything could collapse at any time. Her words left a lasting impression on him, especially after an eight-month absence owing to a knee injury and the inability to rejoin the team even after his recovery.</p><h2><span id=Wedding>Wedding</span></h2><p>The date and venue of the wedding are unknown, although it was performed in Germany because he did not travel back to his own country.
