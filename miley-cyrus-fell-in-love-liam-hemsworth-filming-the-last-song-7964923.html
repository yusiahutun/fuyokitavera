Checking my push notifications for her latest installment in the series has practically become a morning ritual. And today’s TikTok brought me back to 2010, having me queue up The Last Song for the millionth time.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">On Friday, Miley posted a string of TikToks celebrating her new hit "Used to Be Young.” Some were humorous tidbits about her life, like the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>viral 2009 paparazzi shot</a> of her, Taylor Swift, and Demi Lovato, which showed that she’s bisexual.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"If you guys didn't know I was bisexual from this damn picture, I don't know what's wrong with you," she joked.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Others pulled at your heartstrings, specifically <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>part 20</a>, when she opened up about her <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>10-year relationship</a> with her <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>ex-husband, Liam Hemsworth</a>.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>&nbsp;Touchstone/Kobal/Shutterstock</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In the video, Miley held up the iconic movie poster photo of her and Liam as shared that she was obligated to work with Disney on one more project, which led to The Last Song. When she was casting for who would play her boyfriend, Will, she revealed Liam was who she chose.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“We had gotten it down from thousands to the final three. Liam was a part of the final three,” she shared. “We all know how that ended!”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While looking back on the success of the film, Miley revealed why she believes it was “so special" — she was very much falling in love with Liam IRL (I’m not crying, you are).</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Photo credit: Sam Emerson SMPSP/© Touchstone Pictures.
