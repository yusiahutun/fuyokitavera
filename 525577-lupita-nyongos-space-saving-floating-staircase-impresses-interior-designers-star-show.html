Lupita's stairs are edged with dark wood pieces and accented by a chrome metal railing. The spaces between the stairs reveal a glimpse of the art on Lupita's white walls, her sofa, and her wooden side table.</p><p class=align-left><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Homes and Gardens reports </a>that the staircase idea is a favourite among interior designers, mainly if used in small spaces. According to the experts, the floating staircase has beautiful aesthetic benefits for the living room.</p><h2>Ahmed says they offer sleek, modern design</h2>Mohammad Ahmed, interior designer at The Home Guidance, said, "Floating stairs offer a sleek, modern design that can become a focal point of the room. They can be customized with a variety of materials and designs to fit the specific style of any home."<a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/fb55d14d04748461.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Bishop's Humongous Migori Mansion with Scenic Views Stuns Kenyans: "Thought It Was a Mall"</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Jennifer Ebert, Digital Editor at Homes & Gardens, said that floating staircases can amplify the beauty of the rest of your design.</p>"The open design of floating staircases allows the more intentional elements of your design to shine. In Lupita Nyong'o's living room, the floating staircase allows guests to see her wall art from all angles of the room."<p class=align-left>The home experts also revealed that the floating staircase can make a room appear brighter and larger.</p>"Traditional staircases, with their risers and stringers, can create visual obstructions. Floating stairs, on the other hand, have an open design that removes these obstructions, making the space look more open and expansive," he said. "The materials often used in floating stair designs, whether it's polished wood or metal, can reflect light, adding to the room's luminosity," he continued.<p class=align-left>Ebert also said that the open stairs between stairs allow light to flow through rather than blocking it.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/6c444d4f755ef041.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Celestine Ndinda: Njugush's Wife Showcases Their Completed Two-Storey Ruiru Mansion, Luxury Vehicles</span></p></a>"In Lupita's room, the open spaces offer a view of the white walls, which make the room appear even brighter.," she said.<h2>Netizens poke fun at steep staircase</h2><p class=align-left>In another story, an online user, @BillzDaOriginal, took to Twitter to share an image of the <a href=#>construction of a strange-looking staircase</a>.</p><p class=align-left>The funny photo showed an alarmingly steep stairway with a builder at work on the property nearby.</p><p class=align-left>Netizens could not help but laugh and mock the odd structure, which may be a safety hazard for future occupants.</p><p>Source: TUKO.co.ke</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tcHKqGWcp16gsnC8xKinpZ1fan92gZZwZKWtoJ7BonnNsqann5%2BoerS8wJycZquRq7avs4yfo6iZpJ67qHnSrZiiqpOWwKZ5yKanq52jqLK0ecinq56qmaS%2FbrDErKCgppWnwG6%2F05qpZquYpMRw</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
