As the virus brought the world to almost a complete halt, hectic and stressful lifestyles that negatively impact health take a back seat as more people prioritise their well-being. Understanding the importance of improving quality of life through health, Singaporean firm avita is proud to walk down the path to better health with consumers.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The company has always believed in empowering people to live their healthiest and best lives, and has dedicated itself to developing products that support this vision. CEO and founder Lee Xiang Yin established avita in 2007 on the premise that health is a key driver for the progress of individuals and organisations.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Life is a gift that cannot be taken for granted. You cannot control how long you live, but you can create your own value in life. Our mission is to help people and create meaningful and valuable life for all. For a better life, for a better world: this is the mission of avita,” Lee says.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The journey of avita to becoming a health and wellness powerhouse started with aromatherapy. Combining the best of the East and the West, avita initially offered French essential oils and traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) oils. Ensuring that consumers experience the maximum benefits these potent oils have to offer, avita even actively promoted meridian healing – a TCM practice that specifically targets meridians and acupuncture points of the body for health and wellness.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Aiming to help even more people with science-based quality products, avita expanded its scope to include personal care products and cell nutritional supplements. In 2009, the company introduced its signature product, marine cell nutritional supplement Celergen, in cooperation with prestigious Swiss research scientists and pharmaceutical experts.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Developed and manufactured in Switzerland using Swiss cold process DNA extraction technology, Celergen features cartilage-rejuvenating ingredients such as collagen and elastin peptides, and proprietary cellular marine complex extracted from deep-sea marine life DNA. It reduces fatigue, strengthens immune function, and promotes cell renewal and stimulation to delay ageing. Consumers, professors and doctors attest to health improvements as early as two weeks of use, with people from more than 64 countries benefiting from the powerful functions of Celergen.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Another groundbreaking avita product is the Natural Growth Factors (NGF) made from bird’s nest extracts. NGF stimulates the brain and nervous system to produce an abundance of nerve growth factor, a type of protein critical to the growth, maintenance and proliferation of neurons. avita’s NGF is designed to enhance memory retention and help prevent neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Within Asia-Pacific, avita has established offices and branches in Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, Japan, Hong Kong, the Philippines and Australia, and employed a network marketing structure to communicate more effectively with consumers. In these nine markets, the company cooperates with top leaders referred to as diamond presidents in organising product knowledge courses and other learning activities for better distributor engagement.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The company’s products are also available in Myanmar, Vietnam, Cambodia and Brunei. As Asia is one of its particularly important markets, avita also seeks to expand its distribution points in countries where it does not have offices. It is open to working with morally upstanding partners willing to learn and grow with avita.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Why did we choose network marketing? It’s because we want to create opportunities for people to be both healthy and wealthy with our products. If you’re healthy but you don’t have enough money, then you cannot have a good quality of life. On the other hand, if you’re wealthy but not healthy, you can’t have a good quality of life either. These two elements are what we want to create together,” Lee says.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51ksLDBza2psmWimr2wvtOsZpynpaPBs8WMq5ypp6KpwHDAzqmgnKtfqLavs8CppqudXaOutbXOp5ilZZSWxm5%2Bj2toaJmiqbakuMRoampsZGmDcXvAr6CtmV2aurG71p6prA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
