This was a big deal, considering I was attached to my long, glamorous locks. Though once I made the chop, I was addicted; I went shorter every other month, and my once free-flowing mane barely reached chin level (think, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Hailey Bieber chic</a>). But after 10 months, I wanted my long tresses back, and thus started my <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>hair growth journey</a>. I tried just about everything including collagen gummies, hair growth shampoos, serums, and more, but nothing quite worked like the <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Kreyòl Essence Haitian Black Castor Oil</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Kreyòl Essence Haitian Black Castor Oil</a> comes from an eco-friendly brand that supplies <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nocaes>economic opportunities</a> for the women of Haiti. Dubbed “liquid gold” by the brand during a segment of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel="sponsored nofollow nocaes">Shark Tank</a>, the nourishing $28 oil can be used on the scalp, eyelashes, and eyebrows. It includes ricinoleic acid, which is the “fatty acid component” that “increase[s] blood flow to the hair follicles,” <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=4 rel=nocaes>Dr. DiAnne Davis</a>, a board-certified cosmetic dermatologist, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=5>previously told InStyle</a>. Coupled with omega fats, the concoction improves hair health by moisturizing the scalp and creating an environment for restoration.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-kreyl-essence-haitian-black-castor-oil></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Kreyòl Essence Haitian Black Castor Oil</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_6-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">I mix five dropperfuls of the castor oil with three dropperfuls of rosemary oil and apply the mixture to my scalp three times a week. I work the product in utilizing a scalp massager, like this <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">on-sale $8 Heeta find</a>, wrap my hair in an <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">overnight sleep cap</a>, and go to bed. I wash the product out in the morning using a detoxifying scrub or with a double rinse. But I get it, sometimes you don’t have all the time in the world. Leaving the product in for 30 minutes before a shower also gets the job done. Another hack? Use the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel=nocaes>castor oil as a styling aid</a> like Bieber. You’ll achieve a balletcore bun with hair health benefits.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">It’s been two months since I started using the <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Kreyòl Essence castor oil</a>, and my hair has grown two inches. Being that my hair usually takes months to grow an inch, this is a major feat. It’s also helped with frizziness, shine, and strength, and while I still have a ways to go when it comes to my hair goals, I may be giving Rapunzel a run for her money.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Shoppers are blown away by the results too, with <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">one saying</a> their “hair is growing like wildfire.” “I had postpartum shedding on my edges and they were practically bald,” said <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">another reviewer</a>. After “two weeks,” they noticed new hair growth and would now “recommend [the oil] to anyone!” Even more impressive, <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">a shopper</a> noticed hair growth after just one week, claiming her “hair was growing like crazy!” This isn’t just for the ladies, either. <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=4 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">One male user</a> saw results after two weeks, and experienced tremendous hair growth after three months. In short? It’s a “great product and worth the money,” according to the same buyer.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Kreyòl Essence Haitian Black Castor Oil</a> is also proven to help with various skin conditions. “I have horrible eczema on my foot,” said an <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Amazon shopper</a>. “I have only been using this item for three days and what a world of difference.” Another reviewer who has tried “over 50 products” to help their psoriasis claimed the Kreyòl castor oil has made a “huge difference” on their hands, without stinging. “This is my favorite by far,” <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">they concluded</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If you’re at your wits end when it comes to hair growth (or tricky skin conditions), don’t give up just yet. Give the <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Kreyòl Essence Haitian Black Castor Oil</a> a shot.
