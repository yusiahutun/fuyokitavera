Visa USA</p><p>will present the 2004 national tour of the highly-acclaimed dance musical that has thrilled audiences of all ages since it opened to rave reviews last October.<br>Visa will be the only card accepted for single-ticket sales of "Movin' Out" on tour, which will bring the acclaimed production to major cities across the United States starting in February. Based on 30 songs by Billy Joel and conceived, choreographed and directed by Twyla Tharp, "Movin' Out" was nominated for 10 Tony Awards and won two: Best Choreography and Best Orchestrations.</p><p>"Visa's sponsorship of the 'Movin' Out' national tour extends our strong and long-standing Broadway relationship to Visa member and merchant partners nationwide through a wide-ranging program including a national advertising campaign," said Becky Saeger, executive vice president, Brand Marketing, Visa USA. "And 'Movin' Out' is the perfect partner for Visa. With its unique blend of classic Billy Joel tunes and the exuberant dance of Twyla Tharp, 'Movin' Out' crosses the generations, from those who grew up with Billy Joel to those who are discovering his great songs for the first time. This is another example of Visa giving cardholders the unique opportunity to enjoy and experience the varied possibilities that life has to offer."</p><p>Over the years, Visa has been one of Broadway's major supporters. Visa is the only card accepted at the prestigious American Theatre Wing's Antoinette Perry "Tony" Awards(R) on CBS-TV. Over the years, Visa has produced six Broadway-themed national TV commercials including three national television spots promoting the Tony Awards. Visa's relationship with the League of American Theatres and Producers has led to Visa's support of numerous shows and the annual "Broadway on Broadway" season kick-off near Times Square. Visa also is proud sponsor of Live Broadway's Open House Tours, a backstage look at the Broadway community and the American Theatre Wing's charitable efforts.</p><p>"We are extremely privileged to have been chosen by Visa USA for this sponsorship and look forward to a long and mutually beneficial relationship," said James L. Nederlander, lead producer of "Movin' Out." "The reach of an entity like Visa USA will take the national profile of 'Movin' Out' far beyond the limits of a typical theatrical marketing budget. The last time Visa sponsored a single theatrical touring production was on the national tour of 'A Chorus Line,' which is humbling company to keep. We celebrate this honor with pride and gratitude not only for this sponsorship on the national tour but also for the ongoing support of the Broadway production."</p><p>The Visa/"Movin' Out" relationship will be backed by a robust integrated marketing program including a national Visa television advertising campaign, local marketing support and a special website — <a href=#>Visa</a> — for ticket purchases. Visa is also supporting the national tour with a variety of special "Movin' Out" experiences and tie-ins that theatres, Visa member banks and merchants can use to drive card usage at the regional tour locations such as Visa exclusive ticket offers and sweepstakes.</p><p>"Visa's national television commercial will make 'Movin' Out' an event that expands the definition of Broadway and in so doing attracts a broader audience to our theatres," says Albert Nocciolino, president of NAC Enterprises, presenter of Broadway shows in seven cities. "This sponsorship is an exciting opportunity for theatrical presenters operating outside of New York to work together on a national scale to introduce new ways to sell tickets to the shows that play in our cities."</p><p>The complete schedule for the "Movin' Out" national tour will be announced in the fall although it was disclosed that the tour will include about 25 stops and a minimum of 52 weeks in major cities such as Chicago, Washington, D.C. and San Francisco. "Movin' Out" opened on Oct. 24, 2002 and continues to at the Richard Rodgers Theatre in New York.</p><span itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Article class=itempropwp-wrap></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCam5OawLR6wqikaJuRlr%2BktMivnGiumaiubsDOZqqpp56ovLN50aiYnWWkpMKzec6fZKanpp67brvUrWY%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
