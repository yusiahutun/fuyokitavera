However, the Batman villain never actually appeared to fight Batman (Robert Pattinson) or Catwoman (<a href=#>Zoë Kravitz</a>). As fans watch or re-watch <a href=#>The Batman</a> on HBO Max, they ask again who the mysterious Salvatore Maroni is in DC Comics and the wider DC Extended Universe?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Who-Is-The-Batman-Mystery-Villain-Sal-Maroni.jpg><h2>Who is Batman villain Sal Maroni in DC Comics?</h2><p id=par-2_44>In The Batman, Sal Maroni operated as a gangster before Carmine Falcone brought him down, long before he could terrorize Pattinson’s Dark Knight. While the Gotham City mobster never appeared in the DC Universe movie, he has hugely influenced Bruce Wayne over the years.</p><p id=par-3_41>As a Gotham City organized crime leader, he has appeared in the Tim Burton and Michael Keaton Batman movies, the Dark Knight trilogy, the Gotham TV series, and even animated media like <a href=#>Batman: The Long Halloween</a> and Batman: The Killing Joke.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-2></figure><p id=par-4_50>In <a href=#>DC Comics</a>, he’s considered one of the most dangerous Gotham City crime lords, just behind Carmine Falcone. He’s usually credited for burning Harvey Dent’s face, turning him into Two-Face. He even has ties to the Batman villain Tony Zucco, the man responsible for killing Dick Grayson, aka Robin’s, parents.</p><p id=par-5_16>However, Matt Reeves chose to shroud Sal Maroni in a bit more mystery in The Batman.</p><h2>Who is Salvatore Maroni in Matt Reeves’ ‘The Batman’?</h2><p id=par-6_56>In The Batman, Sal Maroni was a mobster ultimately brought down by Carmine Falcone. As Batman worked to stop <a href=#>the Riddler (Paul Dano)</a>, the mystery of his parents’ deaths came up repeatedly. One of the biggest mysteries Batman tackled revolved around how the GCPD brought charges against Maroni. The Riddler teased the message “el rata alada.”</p><p id=par-7_16>This led to Batman figuring out the identity of “The Rat,” who made arresting Maroni possible.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-3><p lang=en dir=ltr>2. Who was the rat?</p><p>Rataalada. Carmine Falcone (John Turturro) was the rat. Years prior to the events of The Batman, he tipped the police off to his main competitor in organized crime in Gotham, Salvatore Maroni, which led to the biggest drug bust in Gotham history. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/jH9SkdO9Qf</a></p>— Fatherly (@FatherlyHQ) <a href=#>March 10, 2022</a></figure><p id=par-8_30>Carmine Falcone, Sal Maroni, Thomas, and Martha Wayne all had connections. However, as Batman uncovered more shocking clues with <a href=#>Commissioner Gordon</a> (Jeffrey Wright), the details twisted to form a picture.</p><p id=par-9_39>Falcone exposed Sal Maroni in The Batman universe to eliminate his competition and secure more of Thomas Wayne’s Renewal Fund. However, while Salvatore Maroni does not have the power he once did, fans might wonder if he could return.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-could-the-villain-appear-in-a-sequel-to-the-robert-pattinson-movie>Could the villain appear in a sequel to the Robert Pattinson movie?</h2><p id=par-10_40>Matt Reeves has already revealed that he has big ideas for The Batman sequels. With <a href=#>Colin Farrell</a> set to return as the Penguin in a spinoff series and a GCPD TV show in the works, more Batman villains could surface.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-4><p lang=en dir=ltr>Also, all of this talk of Sal Maroni means we have to be getting Harvey Dent / Two-Face soon.
