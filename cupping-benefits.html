But cupping has been a thing long before Olympic swimmers and gymnasts were having cupping treatments to ease muscle strain. Yes, it was around even before Gwyneth Paltrow walked the red carpet in 2004 with evidence of cupping on her back, before Madonna Instagrammed her back during a cupping session, and before Justin and Hailey Bieber showed off their cupping marks during a beach trip.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The practice dates back to ancient Egypt and China and can be used for anything from boosting your circulation and immune system to calming your nerves, or even acne. And it's having a moment again right now â€” after all, it's quick, affordable, non-invasive, and you can even take the treatment on-the-go with you with new at-home cupping kits.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Here's what you need to know about what cupping therapy does, its side effects (which include those often-Instagrammed circular marks) and all the potential benefits this traditional East Asian medicine treatment can have for your health.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-is-cupping></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What is cupping?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Cupping (and the marks it can leave behind) might sound a little intimidating, but the process is pretty straightforward. "A suction cup is placed on the body that lifts up on the connective tissue and muscles to create a mild stretch and increase circulation," says licensed acupuncturist <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Shari Auth</a>, DACM [Doctor of Acupuncture and Chinese Medicine], co-founder and Chief Healing Officer at <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>WTHN</a> in New York City.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">You'll often see static cupping, where the suction cup is suctioned on a fixed place on the body, like the back, which creates a stronger effect and might leave marks. But there's also another type of cupping, called moving cupping, in which a practitioner uses a lubricant to slide the suction cups along the surface of the skin. This leaves fewer marks typically, and can even be used on the skin of the face, Auth explains.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">It's common to pair cupping with an acupuncture treatment to increase the benefits. "Acupuncture works [primarily] on the internal systems, like hormones and digestion, whereas cupping is more beneficial to the outer layers of the body, like muscle tension or immunity," says <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Anna Gold</a>, DACM, a licensed acupuncturist based in the San Francisco Bay, California area. The combo of the two might help you feel more relaxed and release more tension than just one or the other practice alone. However, both acupuncture and cupping have their health perks if you choose to have the treatments by themselves, too.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-the-benefits-of-cupping></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>The Benefits of Cupping</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>It helps with muscle recovery.</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">One of the classic reasons cupping is used is for muscle repair. If your muscles are tight, sore, or even if you have acute pain, cupping might help, especially paired with an acupuncture session, Auth says. According to a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>2021 study</a>, cupping applies pressure to the soft tissue, and that stress in the blood vessels pushes the body to create anti-inflammatory proteins that help jump-start muscle recovery. The relief may take about 24 hours to set in, though, the research states.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Cupping enhances circulation.</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Beyond your soft tissue, cupping reaches your blood to increase circulation. "The cups isolate blood through this suction, and then de-oxygenate unhealthy or stagnant blood, which usually shows up as chronic pain or muscle tension," explains <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Gabriel Sher</a>, board-certified acupuncturist and Director of Acupuncture at <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>ORA</a> in New York City. "Once the cups are removed, the body sends new and fresh red blood cells to regenerate these areas," he adds.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Because of that suction temporarily cutting off blood flow and drawing heavier blood (which can increase the risk of blood clots) out, you might feel some discomfort during cupping. Though once the heavier blood moves out of the bloodstream, thinner, healthier blood regulated with salts and potassium can circulate, Sher says.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>It might help treat some G.I. issues.</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>acupuncture</a>, cupping is another mode of getting things moving in your digestive system, and may be used to treat conditions like IBS and constipation. "For gastrointestinal issues, cupping on the abdomen improves circulation and moves gas through the intestines," Sher says. That can help relieve bloating and constipation for sure, and also stimulates peristalsis, the contraction of the stomach muscles that helps digestion move along.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Cupping may be used to relieve some skin conditions.</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_35-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">It's possible that cupping can be a helpful treatment option for symptoms of some inflammatory skin conditions, including acne and hives, Sher points out. One study published in the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Journal of Integrative Medicine</a><strong> </strong>suggests that cupping, especially in combination with an antihistamine, can quell allergic reactions associated with chronic urticaria (aka recurring hives). The cupping process helps the blood create histamine-like substances to fight off the allergic reaction.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_37-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Other <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>research</a> found that certain types of cupping might be helpful for quicker healing of severe acne, since there's increased blood flow to that area.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_39-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>It can help your breathing.</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_41-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If you're having breathing issues, either chronic or from being sick, cupping may be worth a try. "In East Asian medicine, cupping is utilized to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>move stagnation</a> (increase circulation and decrease pain). This also adds to opening up the lungs to relieve asthmatic breathing, and expelling wind pathogens, which may help treat symptoms of colds, viruses, and the flu," Gold says.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_43-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Cupping may boost your immunity.</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_45-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Now we're not suggesting that cupping will prevent or cure Covid, but it might contribute to an overall healthy immune response. Because the suction cups create a temporary site of inflammation, the immune system shifts into high gear to diffuse that inflammation, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>research</a> has found. Also, cupping stimulates the movement of healthy red blood cells, which are essential to immune system function.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_47-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>It can lower your cholesterol.</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_49-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Cupping has been <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>shown</a> to lower cholesterol, Gold explains. Why? Better circulation of blood can prevent clotting or blockages from high levels of LDL, a type of protein associated with high cholesterol.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_51-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Cupping may calm your nervous system.</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_53-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The process of cupping may contribute to better moods overall, or at least a sense of relaxation afterward, Gold says. It activates the parasympathetic nervous system, which pushes the body into "rest and digest" mode after the pressure increases and blood supply is cut off, according to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>research</a>. That helps deactivate the sympathetic nervous system, says Gold, which is the part of your nervous system responsible for sweating, panicking, and all other times you're in "fight or flight mode."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-are-there-any-cupping-side-effects></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_55-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Are there any cupping side effects?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_56-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Most commonly, cupping will result in those signature circular marks that can appear from the increased circulation where the cup was placed, Auth says. Those marks, which are not technically bruises, won't necessarily be painful, and they'll likely go away in three to ten days, she adds. If you want them to fade faster, try cardio exercise or a hot bath to increase your circulation. You can also apply arnica cream to the marks to help them fade, Auth says.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_58-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">There are a few other rare side effects from cupping. They include lightheadedness, nausea, soreness, and skin discoloration after the treatment, Gold says.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-can-anyone-try-cupping></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_60-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Can anyone try cupping?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_61-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If you have any kind of broken skin, wound, rash, or skin abrasion, you should hold off on cupping and wait until those heal, Sher says. And cupping isn't recommended for anyone with sunburn or psoriasis either, adds Gold, so it doesn't further irritate burnt or sensitive skin. Cupping is also not recommended for people with bleeding disorders or abscesses, she adds. And heads' up, if you're currently pregnant, you can try cupping as long as it's comfortable, but your practitioner should know to avoid using cupping on certain areas of the body.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-the-bottom-line-on-cupping></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_63-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>The Bottom Line on Cupping</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_64-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If you're curious about the many benefits of cupping, it might be worth giving the ancient treatment a try. It's low-risk, non-invasive, and unlike many of the wellness treatments popularized by Hollywood stars and Olympians alike, this one's actually accessible â€” most cupping sessions run from $30 to $80, depending on where you're located.
