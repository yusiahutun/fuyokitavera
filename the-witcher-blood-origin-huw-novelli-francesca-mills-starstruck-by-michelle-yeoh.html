Michelle comes from a kind of dance background when she was younger and it's more fluid…not everything has to hit a beat. So, those were the tips that she gave me really, and <strong>I'm very, very thankful</strong> for them."</p><p id=emdRtg-7x6Ru data-wc=1><strong>MORE:&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>9 Christmas movies that are coming out in 2022</a></strong></p><p id=eL_2K2Hbpxmn data-wc=1><strong>READ: <a class=hm-link href=#>Blood, Sex and Royalty's Max Parker shares big difference between show and The Crown – and teases playing Prince Harry</a></strong></p><p id=ehkhscxYJY4k data-wc=82>Francesca added: "And just watching Michelle in the fights…the day that we were on set with Michelle learning the fights, Adam Horton the stunt co-ordinator would be explaining to me and Huw what we were supposed to be doing like 'one more time' or 'could you go do that one more time.'
