When Windows takes forever to boot, you'll dread turning on or rebooting your computer.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Thankfully, slow booting is a solvable issue. We'll show you the most common fixes for slow startup problems in Windows 10.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong><strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This guide is focused on Windows 10. See <a href=#>How to Fix a Slow Startup on Windows 11</a> for instructions specific to that version of Windows.</p><h2 id=disable-fast-startup>1. Disable Fast Startup</h2><p>One of the most problematic settings that will cause slow boot times in Windows 10 is <a href=#>the <strong>fast startup</strong> option</a>. This is enabled by default and is supposed to reduce startup time by pre-loading some boot information before your PC shuts off. (Note that while this applies to shutting down, restarting your computer isn't affected by this feature.)</p><p>While the name sounds promising, it causes issues for a lot of people. Thus, it's the first setting you should toggle when you have slow boot problems.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>To disable Fast Startup, open <strong>Settings</strong> and browse to <strong>System > Power & sleep</strong>. On the right side of this screen, click <strong>Additional power settings</strong> to open the <strong>Power Options</strong> menu in the Control Panel.</p><p>Here, click <strong>Choose what the power buttons do</strong> on the left sidebar. You'll need to provide administrator permission to change the settings on this page, so click the text at the top of the screen that reads <strong>Change settings that are currently unavailable</strong>.</p><p>Now, untick <strong>Turn on fast startup (recommended)</strong>, followed by <strong>Save Changes</strong>, to disable this setting.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Windows-10-Fast-Startup-Disable.png><p>If you don't see <strong>fast startup</strong> here, you don't have hibernation enabled and thus it won't show up. To enable hibernation, open an administrator Command Prompt or PowerShell window. You can do this by right-clicking on the Start button or hitting <strong>Win + X</strong> and choosing <strong>Command Prompt (Admin)</strong> or <strong>Windows PowerShell (Admin)</strong>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Type the following command to enable hibernation, then try to disable fast startup again:</p><p><strong>powercfg /hibernate on</strong></p><h2 id=adjust-paging-file-settings>2. Adjust Paging File Settings</h2><p>Virtual memory is the name of a function that makes Windows dedicate part of your storage drive as pretend RAMâ€”this section is called the paging file. With more RAM, you can have more tasks running on your system at once. So if Windows is close to maxing out actual RAM, it dips into virtual memory.</p><p>Some people have found that Windows 10 can change virtual memory settings on its own, causing boot issues. You should thus <a href=#>have a look at your virtual memory settings</a> and see if you can change them to fix the slow boot problem.</p><p>To do this, type <strong>Performance</strong> into the Start Menu and choose <strong>Adjust the appearance and performance of Windows</strong>. Under the <strong>Advanced</strong> tab, you'll see the size of the paging file; click <strong>Change</strong> to edit it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Windows-10-Advanced-Performance-Options.png><p>On the resulting window, the bottom values are what's important. You'll see a <strong>Recommended</strong> amount of memory and a <strong>Currently Allocated</strong> value. Some users having this issue find that their current allocation is way over the recommended number.</p><p>If yours looks off in the same way, uncheck <strong>Automatically manage paging file size for all drives</strong> to make changes. Then choose <strong>Custom Size</strong> and set the <strong>Initial Size</strong> and <strong>Maximum Size</strong> to the recommended values that appear for your system (which may be different than the below screenshot). Reboot, and your boot times should improve.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Windows-10-Adjust-Paging-File-Size.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=turn-off-the-linux-subsystem>3. Turn Off the Linux Subsystem</h2><p><a href=#>Windows 10 offers a full Linux terminal</a> in addition to other shell environments like the classic Command Prompt. This is exciting for developers, but it might also be the culprit of your boot issues. However, this feature isn't turned on by default. So if you don't know what Bash is, you likely don't need to try this step, as you would know if you had turned it on.</p><p>To turn off the Linux shell, type <strong>Windows features</strong> into the Start Menu to open the <strong>Turn Windows features on or off</strong> menu. Scroll down to <strong>Windows Subsystem for Linux</strong>, uncheck it, and restart.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Windows-Turn-Off-Linux-Subsystem.png><p>If this fixes your slow boot issues but you still need the Bash interface, <a href=#>try the new Windows terminal</a> for another option.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=update-graphics-drivers>4. Update Graphics Drivers</h2><p>Windows 10 is known to mess with drivers, unfortunately. <a href=#>Updating your graphics card drivers</a> can sometimes fix boot issues, so you should give that a look next.</p><p>Open the Device Manager by right-clicking on the Start button (or hitting <strong>Win + X</strong>) and choosing <strong>Device Manager</strong>. Navigate to <strong>Display adapters</strong> to see which graphics card you're using (typically Nvidia or AMD if you have a dedicated graphics card).</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Windows-10-Graphics-Driver-Check.png><p>You can usually open the corresponding vendor software on your PC to check for graphics driver updates. If you don't have the software, you'll need to navigate to the vendor's website (or your laptop manufacturer's website, if you're using integrated graphics) to check for driver updates.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Install any new versions available, restart, then see if your boot times speed up.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/AMD-Graphics-Check-for-Updates.png><p>We've covered <a href=#>updating your computer drivers</a> in more detail if you need help. Hopefully, an update will fix your issue. It could be worth checking for other driver updates while you're doing this, but graphics drivers are the most common ones that will cause slow booting.</p><p>While you're installing updates, it's not a bad idea to check for Windows updates at <strong>Settings > Update & Security > Windows Update</strong> and install anything that's pending.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=disable-some-startup-programs>5. Disable Some Startup Programs</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/startup-tab-task-manager.jpg><p>Perhaps your slow boot time isn't caused by one of the problems above. If you experience slowness between logging in and actually getting to use your computer, too many programs running at startup could be the culprit.</p><p>Upon installation, or even sometimes when updating, a lot of software sets itself to automatically run at startup. If you have dozens of apps loading as soon as you log in, this can really bog your system down. Follow our <a href=#>guide to removing heavy startup programs</a> and see if unloading a few makes a difference.</p><h2 id=run-an-sfc-scan>6. Run an SFC Scan</h2><p>The SFC (System File Checker) command will check your Windows installation for corrupted system files and try to replace them with working copies. It's worth running this to troubleshoot the startup issue, as some Windows files responsible for the booting process could be the cause of your slow startup.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>See our <a href=#>guide to SFC and related Command Prompt tools</a> to learn how to use it.</p><h2 id=if-all-else-fails-perform-a-reset>7. If All Else Fails, Perform a Reset</h2><p>If you've tried all the above solutions and still can't speed up your boot time, it might be best to cut your losses and reinstall a fresh copy of Windows 10.</p><p>You have several <a href=#>options for resetting your PC</a>. The built-in Refresh option can reinstall Windows without removing any of your files. You should still <a href=#>back up your computer data</a> before doing this, though.</p><p>Head to <strong>Settings > Update & Security > Recovery</strong> and select <strong>Get started</strong> under <strong>Reset this PC</strong> to start.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Windows-10-Recovery-Refresh.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=upgrade-your-storage-drive>8. Upgrade Your Storage Drive</h2><p>If you run Windows from an HDD, you'll experience slow performance across the board. Hard disk drives are great for storing lots of data for a low cost, but are too slow to use as your main OS disk these days.</p><p>If possible on your machine, you should look to <a href=#>upgrade to an SSD</a>, which will improve Windows' performance considerably. This does incur an additional cost, but an SSD is a major upgrade you'll appreciate.</p><h2 id=slow-booting-in-windows-10-begone>Slow Booting in Windows 10, Begone</h2><p>Hopefully, applying one or all of these fixes worked for you. Slow startup times are a huge pain, but you thankfully have options to combat this. If nothing else works, hold out for the next major Windows 10 release, which should hopefully clear up the issue. Alternatively, consider updating to Windows 11.</p><p>In case your slowness persists well after booting, you should be aware of other ways to make your Windows PC faster, too.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3KnqysnZ%2Bbe6S7zGirmp9frLavsM6wqmZpYGLArbvWZpmop6RitrS%2F1J6qaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
