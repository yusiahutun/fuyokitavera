She almost broke the internet back in 2013 when she posted a snap of her breastfeeding while in the hair and makeup chair. "What would I do without this beauty squad after the 15 hours flying and only 3 hours of sleep #multitasking#gettingready," she wrote.<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">But back in August 2010, Bündchen found herself backtracking on comments she made about breastfeeding after the birth of her son Benjamin. "Some people here think they don't have to breastfeed, and I think, 'Are you going to give chemical food to your child, when they are so little?' There should be a worldwide law, in my opinion, that mothers should breastfeed their babies for six months," she told Harper's BAZAAR UK at the time. She took to her blog in a now-deleted post to apologize, writing: "I'm not here to judge. ... I think as mothers we are all just trying our best."</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 e1jtuqk11"></span><h5 class="css-13733z5 e1jtuqk13">41 Celebrities Who Admitted to Plastic Surgery And Injectables</h5><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 e1jtuqk10"></span><img alt="la detresse summer trip collection celebration" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/bella-hadid-attends-la-detresse-summer-trip-collection-news-photo-1662044840.jpg title="La Detresse Summer Trip Collection Celebration" width=1024 height=683 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center>Open Gallery<span class="css-1w4f7je es31yw60"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/arrow-right.7440adc.svg alt title="Black right arrow" width=100% height=auto decoding=async role=img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/a5b794e4-ba0e-4527-9e9d-e98142b9fbef_1526586861.jpg alt="Headshot of Jenna Rosenstein" title="Headshot of Jenna Rosenstein" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Jenna Rosenstein is the Beauty Director at Harper's BAZAAR across both print and digital. While attending NYU, she held internships at Women’s Wear Daily, Bloomingdale’s, Harper’s BAZAAR, and Allure, the latter of which she parlayed into her first job as the Beauty Assistant. She left Allure three years later as the Senior Beauty Editor. She spent a few months at Refinery29 overseeing branded content in the same title, before finally landing back at BAZAAR to manage all beauty content. When she's not testing every lipstick known to mankind, getting zapped by new lasers, or interviewing experts and celebrities, you can find Rosenstein at home in New Jersey with her son, husband, and black cat named Maddie.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfl7KiwdOyZqGdkaHBqXvAa2ptb2Zpg3p7xqKqnqSVYq%2B2usOcn56mXZe8sK6Mo6abZaChrrTAyJxkrK2inLKzxY4%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
