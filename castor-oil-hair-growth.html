It has easily become one of the most talked about ingredients for boosting <a href=# id=auto-tag_hair-growth data-tag=hair-growth>hair growth</a>, with folks across the Internet claiming the oil works miracles on anywhere from their roots to their eyebrows. But how many of these legendary results can be attributed to <a href=# id=auto-tag_castor-oil data-tag=castor-oil>castor oil</a> alone? We asked a dermatologist to squash some of our qualms and lend a bit of truth.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/anua-heartleaf-toner-tiktok.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/beauty-of-joseon-fi.jpg><p>Table Of Contents</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=what-is-castor-oil>What is castor oil?</h2><p>As regenerative medicine expert and WeThrivv Founder, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Dr. Sanjay Batra</a>, shared with StyleCaster, <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://stylecaster.com/beauty/hair-nails/1650206/cliganic-castor-oil/ rel="noreferrer noopener">castor oil</a> is produced from the bean of the castor oil plant (Ricinus communis L.) and is rich in triglycerides, fatty acids and ricinoleic acid. “Castor oil has been used for hundreds, if not thousands of years for skin, hair and digestive concerns.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=how-can-castor-oil-be-beneficial-for-hair-growth>How can castor oil be beneficial for hair growth?</h2><p>According to Dr. Batra, the active ingredient, ricinoleic acid, does <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://stylecaster.com/beauty/hair-nails/1610573/essential-oils-hair-growth/ rel="noreferrer noopener">offer multiple hair growth benefits</a>. It’s anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial, meaning it can soothe an irritated scalp and combat fungal overgrowth or bacteria that can contribute to thin, weakened hair. “The most important thing is that castor oil may reduce the production of prostaglandin D2 by a stressed scalp, thereby lowering the amount of this hair growth inhibitor in the hair follicles,” he said.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=what-should-you-look-for-in-a-castor-oil>What should you look for in a castor oil?</h2><p>If there’s one thing you should absolutely keep in mind, it’s that <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://stylecaster.com/beauty/hair-nails/1650206/cliganic-castor-oil/ rel="noreferrer noopener">castor oil must be pure</a>, not in the form of soap which will wash out of your hair. “For quality, it is better that the oil was produced by ‘cold pressing’ so that there were no chemical reactions that destroyed the oils or created adverse artifacts….Make sure to look for high-quality, minimally formulated products that contain pure castor oil. Avoid additives and toxic ingredients that can irritate the scalp and cause hair thinning, shedding and breakage,” said Dr. Batra. For one example, if castor oil is processed into a cream, it may contain sulphates, which are damaging to the strands and scalp and may prevent the oil from staying in place after washing. “Pure cold pressed oil is better than a blended oil!”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=what-are-the-best-ways-to-apply-castor-oil>What are the best ways to apply castor oil?</h2><p>As Dr. Batra explains, “Unfortunately, <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://stylecaster.com/beauty/hair-nails/1648662/sky-organics-castor-oil/ rel="noreferrer noopener">castor oil</a> will not dissolve in water, which can pose a challenge to the consumer, who needs to dilute it, then evenly distribute it over the scalp. Dilution and even distribution is essential to get maximum benefit from the oil without negatively affecting the cosmetic appearance of hair.”</p><p>Fortunately, there are two very simple at home tricks that can facilitate a professional and sophisticated cosmetic routine, according to Dr. Batra. “The first is to combine a small amount of the oil, perhaps half a teaspoon, with an equal amount of <a data-pmc-sp-product=8296328a1a6fca83deaf87a1d7701a38 href=# custom-ga-data='{"1pd":true,"category":"article-page","details":"soy lecithin","label":"buy-now","event_type_label":"Affiliate","url":true,"product":{"dimension1":"%=href=%","name":"Pure Soy Lecithin Powder Vegan OU Kosher Certified - 50g/2oz","price":"7.99","id":"B00BTI83QU","category":"Lecithin"},"id":1606484,"location":true}' custom-ga-track=click rel=nofollow>soy lecithin</a> , mix thoroughly then add a little water, perhaps a whole teaspoon, to start the mixing process. Once mixed perfectly, dilute it into half a liter of water, and add a teaspoon to your hair and mix thoroughly.”</p><p><strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">RELATED: A Derm Explains the Benefits of Using Rosemary Oil For Hair Growth</a></strong></p><p>“The second trick is a little more sophisticated. If you mix half a teaspoon of <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://stylecaster.com/beauty/skin-care/1345397/eva-naturals-castor-oil-amazon/ rel="noreferrer noopener">castor oil</a> with an equal amount of sodium bicarbonate, then throw the mixture into a cup of water, the ricinoleic acid and other free fatty acids will extract into the water, leaving an oily layer on top that is depleted of the active ingredients. Use the water, not the oily film, apply a few teaspoons to the scalp, mix thoroughly, then follow up with apple cider vinegar. When the vinegar is added there will be some fizzing, like sherbet. This will fix the active ingredients to your hair and scalp, so you can immediately rinse your hair with water and get on with your day.”</p><p>Now that you’re equipped with the proper information, you may be ready to give castor oil a go in the hopes of remedying your thinning scalp, bare lashes or sparse brows.
