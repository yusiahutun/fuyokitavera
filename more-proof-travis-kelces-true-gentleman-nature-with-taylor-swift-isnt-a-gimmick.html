A few weeks ago, he sent Swifites wild as he <a href=#>ushered a bodyguard</a> out of the way, before opening the door for her himself.</p><p>As the clip went viral on X, formerly known as <a href=#>Twitter</a>, Jason Kelce asked his brother on their podcast, New Heights, if he feels like he needs to act as the Love Story star’s ‘bodyguard.’</p><p>In response, he said: “I feel like whenever I’m on a date I’m always having the sense, like, I’m a man in the situation. I’m protective.”</p><p>After fans got over the fangirling of that video, it started all over again as the duo were spotted sharing a <a href=#>kiss in public</a> for the very first time.

She’s been seen sitting with his parents at Chief games, and his dad has now spoken out about how “sweet” the star is.</p><p>In an <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">interview</a> with PEOPLE, Ed Kelce gushed about how she was “a very, very sweet, very charming, down-to-earth young woman.”</p><p>He also went on to tell the publication about “something special” he noticed on the first meeting.</p><p>“We’re sitting in the suite, she gets up and in the front room, she gets up to go get a drink or something and she starts picking up empty bottles, cans, plates that are scattered around. Because in the suites everybody gets stuff and you empty it down wherever you can.”</p><p>It’s not only Ed who appears to be a fan of the relationship. Earlier this week, brother Jason <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">told</a> NBC “I’m happy for my brother that he seems to be in a relationship that he’s excited about, that he is genuine about.”</p><p>However, he did <a href=#>raise some ‘alarm bells’</a> with the amount of press attention his brother was now getting.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmpoX2eDcLnOq5xmqKKkvKd506uYr6GjYrimuMKeqmasoqqybrPEp6ulnZ2Wu266wK2sq51drLa1tIytmLKkn6d6tMPIn6tmoaOjwW6tjKCgpqWZmLhw</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
