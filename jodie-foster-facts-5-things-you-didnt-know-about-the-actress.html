And then there’s the nature, where it doesn’t matter if it’s winter, you can go out in your T-shirt and take a hike. It really makes for the right lifestyle.”</p><h2>I’m a Francophile</h2><p>Jodie attended Le Lycée Français de Los Angeles, a French-language high school, and speaks the language so well that she dubs her own films into French. She also took on a French-speaking role in 2004’s A Very Long Engagement and in 2011 hosted the César Awards — the French equivalent of the Oscars. Magnifique!</p><h2>I Loved Turning 60</h2><p>“I felt these huge shifts the day I turned 30 and the day I turned 60. And 60 was the best shift of all because I was struggling in my 50s,” Jodie admits. “I was sort of like, ‘Am I ever going to do anything meaningful again? Is this all there is?’ Then something happened when I turned 60. I was like, ‘I figured it out. This is good.’”</p><h2>I Don’t Like to Shop</h2><p>“I can’t think of anything I hate more than shopping. I’ve always hated it. My wife [<strong>Alexandra Hedison</strong>] says I spend about $25 on clothes a year. Just underwear, bras and socks. That’s about it.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Jodie-Foster-Facts.jpg><h2>Being a Mom Changed Me</h2><p>The actress has <a href=#>two sons</a> — Charles, 25, and Kit, 22 — with her former partner <strong>Cydney Bernard</strong>. “Motherhood is the most creative thing that ever happened to me,” she says. “It changed me in every possible way. It’s special, it’s great.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46jpp2hlWKzsL%2FTnqlmnpGYwbR5lGaroaGenMBuxc6uZJ2hlKPBbrfNqK5mmZKkwrV506GcZpmTqb%2Bmv9Jo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
