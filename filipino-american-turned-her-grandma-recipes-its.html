Friends who asked were rebuffed and sent off sulking. Even within the family, she kept it a closely guarded secret. But […] she thought I was ready. ‘You’re an executive chef now,’ she said – and so the real cooking lesson could begin.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/02/12/7dcc2855-e1b4-483e-be29-5a9b594f57a9_798e21ed.jpg>“First she pulled a shower cap over her hair, tucking in any stray strands.

When she made the embutido (pork and sausage stuffing), I could’ve been watching [chef] Jacques Pépin: it required the precision of a French farce (finely puréed meat). Then she nested hard-boiled eggs in the stuffing and sewed the bird shut, as calm and steady as a surgeon.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/02/11/41a75f57-ee6f-4885-a492-50ea58612127_300987e1.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“For three years I’d trained in a restaurant kitchen, trying to master high-end French techniques, when Lola had been doing it all along, breezily turning out three stuffed chickens at a time for a party.
