According to Mixmag, Avicii's representatives confirmed that his remaining tour dates this year are still a go.</p><p>Avicii revealed at the end of March, 2016 that he was planning to retire from touring and performing and instead focus on producing music. At the time, he cited health issues and the stress of life on the road.</p><p>"My choices and career have never been driven by material things, although I’m grateful for all the opportunities and comforts my success has availed me," he said, thanking the fans, family, peers, partners and longtime manager Arash "Ash" Pournouri for their support over the years. "I know I am blessed to be able to travel all around the world and perform, but I have too little left for the life of a real person behind the artist," he wrote in announcing his retirement plans. – Staff Writers</p><span itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Article class=itempropwp-wrap></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCam5OawLR6wqikaJuRlr%2BktMivnGiZpp6wqrWMnJinm5WhwG64wKxkr52XlsBuvsSsoJ2dnpjGcA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
