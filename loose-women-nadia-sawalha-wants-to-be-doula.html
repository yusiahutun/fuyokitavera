As many mums know, day three is a particularly difficult time with all those hormones raging, your milk coming in and adapting to motherhood while sleep deprived.</p><p id=eHK7TtNwUSAq data-wc=41>Actress Nadia posted on her Instagram page: "We talk all about day three after giving birth and how hormones and god knows what else played havoc with her heart and mind!
