But, during a recent appearance at the The New Yorker Festival, the 44-year-old comedian said that he actually wanted to be a priest when he was younger.</p><p>“I loved it. I loved the whole idea of it. I loved dressing up. I loved the smell of incense. I mean, I loved the whole idea,” he said, according to <a href=# rel=dofollow>Page Six</a>. Jimmy also revealed that his colleague and the former host of The Colbert Report, Stephen Colbert, was an altar boy in his younger days, too.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/jimmy-fallon-golden-globes-2017.jpg><p>Apparently, Jimmy and Stephen, 54, loved being in the church so much that he said they’ve since talked about “just showing up to a random Mass around the city, and just reliving our altar-boy days.” Jimmy then added, “We might still do it.”</p><p>Jimmy’s love for the church first started with his grandfather. In a previous interview with <a href=# rel=dofollow>NPR’s Fresh Air</a>, he revealed that he became religious because of his family. “My grandfather was very religious, so I used to go to Mass with him at like 6:45 in the morning, serve Mass. And then you made money, too, if you did weddings and funerals,” he said. “You’d get like five bucks. And so I go ‘OK, I can make money too.’ I go, ‘This could be a good deal for me.’ I thought I had the calling.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/jimmy-fallon-steven-colbert.jpg><p>Although Jimmy might have had “the calling,” he luckily decided to pursue a career in comedy instead. He also said he now doesn’t go to church as much as he used to because he said “it’s gotten gigantic.”&nbsp;</p><p>“There’s a band there now, and you got to, you have to hold hands with people through the whole Mass now, and I don’t like doing that,” Jimmy explained. “I mean, it used to be the shaking hands piece was the only time you touched each other.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46joKalqWKzorjLqKVmqKKesrTAjGptcG5lZXw%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
