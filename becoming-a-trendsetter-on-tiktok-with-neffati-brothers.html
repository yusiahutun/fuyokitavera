With the platform gaining popularity during the first lockdown in 2020, we doubt there is a single person who never watched one video from the social media app.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Today we have famous TikTok twins, <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Neffati Brothers</strong></a> under our spotlight to talk about how they create content, how they stay up to date with trends, and much more.</span></p><p><br><span>Jamel & Jamil Neffati, known as Neffati Brothers, have a huge following on <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>TikTok</strong></a>, and they are the trendsetters of the platform. They create entertaining content while also traveling the world, and encouraging their audience to work out.&nbsp;</span></p><p><b>Which platform did you start creating content first & why?</b></p><p><span>It was TikTok and the reason why we started on TikTok was that the app was very trending at that time.</span></p><p><b>How would you compare TikTok and Instagram? If you were starting from scratch again, which one would you give importance to?</b></p><p><span>Instagram is more for modeling, traveling and showing perfection. TikTok is more about expressing yourself, being yourself and not being perfect but original.</span></p><p><b>Do you have a content strategy / plan when posting content? You are mostly in entertainment, but do you plan on widening your segment?</b></p><p><span>Most of the time we are trying to produce quality content. Quality content in our meaning is something that we have to put more effort into than just easy trends that’s viral. We plan videos the day before recording most of the time.</span></p><p><b>Do you get collaborations with brands mostly on TikTok or Instagram?</b></p><p><span>Mostly on TikTok because that’s where we have our biggest audience and what comes with it is bigger engagement.</span></p><p><b>Which one is harder to create content for? Even though TikTok requires quite a lot of editing, your Instagram content also looks professional. How do you manage it?</b></p><p><span>For us it’s much easier to produce TikTok content because we love filming. Instagram requires nice places, always fresh looks etc. Now due to pandemic our Instagram creativity is very limited.</span></p><p><b>What would you do as a job if you weren’t an influencer?</b></p><p><span>If we wouldn’t do social media we would probably do some interesting jobs like for example traveling in a cruise ship or being a teacher or policeman.</span></p><p><b>You have collaborated with many influencers as well. Do you think these collaborations are genuine, like friends hanging out together or do you think they sometimes involve other interests? Like getting more views and such?</b></p><p><span>Most of the time our collaborations were very nice and productive. Unfortunately sometimes you get to meet people that want either to abuse your numbers (big following) for their purpose or people that will come there to do their thing without trying hard to work for your content.</span></p><p><b>How do you keep up with the trends? TikTok is a fast-paced environment. Do you think you are behind sometimes?</b></p><p><span>Being influencers takes more than just 8 hours working a day. By saying this we mean that we are in the industry nearly 24/7 so it’s hard to miss anything. We are sure that we are always up to date with what’s trending and what’s not anymore.</span></p><p><b>What is the favorite video of yours that you created?</b></p><p><span>To be honest we’ve got a lot of our “favourites”. One of our favourite series we did was our MOB content that infected the whole app for a couple of months. Literally all for you page feed was filled with people that joined our trend. We were known as CEOs of the trend and even until today many people know us as Mafia brothers.</span></p><a title=@neffatibrothers href=# rel=noopener>@neffatibrothers</a>Blood makes you related. Loyalty makes you family. <a title=mafiaoc href=# rel=noopener>#mafiaoc</a> <a title=familia href=# rel=noopener>#familia</a> <a title=neffam href=# rel=noopener>#neffam</a><a title="♬ Sail - AWOLNATION" href=# rel=noopener>♬ Sail – AWOLNATION</a><p><br><b>What advice would you give to people who are just starting on social media?</b></p><p><span>First of all you have to create a lot of content and be yourself. Another thing is that social media brings a lot of hate and you have to prepare for it. Last but not least you have to set some goals and work hard to achieve them. If you follow these rules it’s more than sure that one day you will succeed!</span></p><p><strong>It was our pleasure to have this inspirational chat with Neffati Brothers!
