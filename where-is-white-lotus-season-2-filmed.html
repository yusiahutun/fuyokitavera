The "White Lotus" property, in real life, is actually a Four Seasons resort, where Season 1 was exclusively shot in Maui, Hawaii. Now, for Season 2, the show introduces a brand new Four Seasons space that overlooks the Ionian Sea in a picturesque town located along the eastern coast of Sicily.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In this new season, the antics of the fresh new White Lotus guests and employees don't just stop at the hotel. With newly lifted COVID restrictions around filming, scenes venture beyond the confines of the resort and into the surrounding Sicilian area known for its aristocratic Baroque architecture—and it's upping the scales of opulence even further.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Below, explore the luxurious new hotspots that have housed the show’s latest scandalous scenes.</p><img alt="white lotus season 2 filming location" title="white lotus season 2 filming location" width=1920 height=1280 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/meghann-fahy-as-daphne-sullivan-1667589593.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2"></span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">HBO</span></p><h2 data-node-id=8 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">Where is the new 'White Lotus' hotel?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The new Four Seasons property for Season 2 is the<a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.fourseasons.com/taormina/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=" San Domenico Palace in Taormina" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"> San Domenico Palace in Taormina</a>, a city on the Mediterranean island's northern coast—and like in Season 1, the resort is no motel.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The property boasts 111 suites, a spa, courtyards and gardens from the time of the monks, as well as a fine-dining restaurant and a pool-terrace diner. To top it off, the estate features an outdoor infinity pool, which has won over a considerable amount of screen time, per <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.cntraveler.com/hotels/italy/catania/san-domenico-palace-hotel--taormina data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Condé Nast Traveler" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Condé Nast Traveler</a>.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The show's previous location in Hawaii at the Four Seasons Maui was a choice inspired by the fond childhood memories of director Mike White, and its new location bounces off of this. “The longer I spent time there, the more I realized just how complex it is," he said to <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-new-yorker-interview/mike-white-on-money-status-and-appearing-on-survivorhttps://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-new-yorker-interview/mike-white-on-money-status-and-appearing-on-survivor data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="The New Yorker" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">The New Yorker</a> in July 2021. "And it just felt like that might be interesting as a backdrop to this show."</p><h2 data-node-id=12 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">What other destinations are featured?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">On the southeast side of the island is the coastal area of Noto, where characters Harper Spiller (Aubrey Plaza) and Daphne Sullivan (Meghann Fahy) take an overnight ladies' trip to the town's Palazzo Ducezio in a series of revelatory and memorable new scenes. Cefalù, a coastal town on the island's north coast, also serves as a backdrop for many landscape shots featured throughout Season 2.</p><img alt="italy illustration" title="Italy : Illustration" width=1024 height=681 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/cathedral-of-cefalu-sicilian-romanesque-style-or-norman-news-photo-1667338876.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Frédéric Soltan</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span><p>Cefalù in Province of Palermo, Sicily.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Per<a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://deadline.com/2022/09/hbo-white-lotus-second-season-october-date-italy-aubrey-plaza-1235123630/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=" Deadline" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"> Deadline</a>, the series additionally visited Lumina Studios located north of the country's capital city of Rome. And at the outset of the season, new guests Harper (Plaza), Ethan Spiller (Will Sharpe), Cameron Sullivan (Theo James) and Daphne (Fahy) toast to one another aboard yacht on the Ionian Sea just outside the San Domenico Palace.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The expanded filming area for the show's second season has been a definite bonus for White. "I'm not going to complain about being at the Four Seasons Maui, but you do start to feel like it was a Hawaiian Shining,” he said to Entertainment Weekly of the show's previous Maui location. “It was cool this season to be able to feature more of the city and some of the iconic places in Sicily. The canvas gets much bigger and that's a huge improvement.”</p><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/ef84b592-a2b0-47e0-8e6c-e29e8d3ddc25_1619719162.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Sabrina Park" title="Headshot of Sabrina Park" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Sabrina Park is a Digital Fellow at <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">HarpersBAZAAR.com</a> where she covers news, fashion, and culture stories.
