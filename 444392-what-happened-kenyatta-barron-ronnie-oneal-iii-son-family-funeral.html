Many would agree that such an admission of guilt is not quite common in the courtroom. But a court case's trajectory is not predictable, and one man, Ronnie Oneal, did the unthinkable. First, his acting as his defence lawyer was a bold move. Second, his closing statement, whereby he boldly stated that he killed his girlfriend, Kenyatta Barron, was quite bizarre. So, what happened to Barron?</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/ad660aafd47a947a.jpeg><p class=align-left>Have you ever been in a courtroom during a trial?

On top of this, Barron's 8-years old son was wounded during the incident but survived the attack. So, what went down that caused these <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">horrible murders</a>?</p><p class=align-left>The person to blame for Kenyatta Barron’s son's injury and murder is Ronnie Oneal III. According to investigators handling the case, Ronnie shot and beat her girlfriend, Kenyatta Barron, with a shotgun.</p><p class=align-left>After this, he proceeded to Kenyatta's daughter, hitting her with a hatchet. He later wound Kenyatta Barron's son, Ronni Jr. and set the house on fire.</p><p class=align-left>Ronnie Jr. escaped the home with stab wounds and burns and informed detectives that his father had shot his mother before being transported to a <a href=#>hospital for treatment</a>.</p><p class=align-left>When police arrived at the scene at 11:59 pm, Kenyatta Barron's daughter died. Ronnie Oneal III was arrested after discovering the incident, though he first resisted and had to be tasered by <a href=#>police officers</a>.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/6aaebeb44882f06d.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Mwai: Meet Jimmy Kibaki's Beautiful Family, from Rumoured Wives, Children</span></p></a><p class=align-left>While inside the police vehicle, he called Kenyatta Barron the devil and mentioned that the children were the devil's kids. Ronnie was booked into Hillsborough County Jail the following day.</p><h2>Kenyatta’s son survived to tell a shocking tale</h2><p class=align-left>Four days after the incident, on March 22, 2018, Ronnie Jr. recounted the events of the murders to detectives, and they were shocking. According to his story, he figured out how to get out of <a href=#>the house</a> where a neighbour found him.</p><p class=align-left>However, Ronnie Jr. altered his statement while in court when his dad, who represented himself in the case, was interviewing him. He stated that he did not see his father murdering anybody during the testimony. He likely made the statement out of the fear of his father, who appeared to be aggressive.</p><h2>The trial for the Kenyatta Barron and daughter murders</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/54a03a3a4580f15a.jpg><p class=align-left>Kenyatta Barron's <a href=#>family</a> was put on the spot during the trial as the prosecutors tried to unravel the story and give justice to the aggrieved.

But unfortunately, Ronnie III couldn't accept this course and proceeded to act as his attorney.</p><p class=align-left>Also, he claimed that all the evidence presented in court against him was <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">fabricated and manipulated</a> to make him guilty of the crime.</p><p class=align-left>Ronnie Oneal was found guilty on June 21, 2021, of two counts of first-degree murder, one count of attempted first-degree murder, two counts of aggravated child abuse, one count of arson, and one count of resisting a law enforcement officer.</p><p class=align-left>Ronnie was sentenced to <a href=#>three life sentences</a> in prison without the possibility of parole. On top of this, he was given 90 years, running consecutively.</p><p class=align-left>Despite the sentencing and being found guilty, Ronnie stated that he couldn’t be sorry for something that he did not do, and he was not sorry for what he did.

You guys just got to see it for yourself.<p class=align-left>After the case ended, the judge also had something to say, expressing her thoughts about everything that unfolded in court and getting quite emotional.</p>When he said he retrieved the body of Ron’Niveya Oneal from the home, and all he could do was sob, it took every ounce I had not to start sobbing too. Because there is no way, any person with any feeling could have witnessed or seen the photos of what occurred that night and not be haunted for the rest of your life. I know I will be, for the rest of my life, I will be haunted by what I saw as far as the evidence and the abject cruelty of it all.<h2>Kenyatta Barron's autopsy results</h2><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/0fgjhs67csop14kbm.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Man Who Lost KSh 5k Bet on Man U vs Watford Clash Returns Home Early, Finds Wife in Bed with Stranger</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The state’s final witness was Dr. Mary Mainland, a medical examiner for Hillsborough County. She <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">did the autopsy</a> on Kenyatta Barron and revealed some shocking details to the court during her testimony.</p><p class=align-left>According to the results presented in court from the examination:</p>Ms.Barron suffered a gunshot wound on her right back shoulder and another much larger gunshot wound on her right elbow, where actual pellets from the shotgun were recovered. Dr. Mainland stated that Ms. Barron’s right arm was broken into separate places but that these wounds would probably have not been lethal by themselves. Additionally, Ms. Barron suffered numerous injuries to her head, including over 15 separate lacerations to her head, multiple abrasions, and contusions on mainly the left side of her head….<p class=align-left>The autopsy indicated that Kenyatta Barron died from brain haemorrhaging because of blunt force trauma.
