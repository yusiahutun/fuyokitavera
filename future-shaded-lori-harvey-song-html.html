However, it appears that the model is still very much on the “Mask Off” rapper’s mind. Though they are both in new relationships, with Harvey dating actor Michael B. Jordan and Future dating rapper Dess Doir, the Atlanta rapper still has a lot to say about his ex-girlfriend.</p><p id=par-2_46>When the pair broke up after a tumultuous two-year relationship, it seemed to be amicable. Though Harvey tends to <a href=#>keep her personal life private</a>, Future is known for outbursts on social media and in his music. However, the pair went their separate ways without incident.</p><p id=par-3_21>Now, it appears that <a href=#>Future</a> is still in his feelings. In a new song, he can be heard shading Harvey.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Future.jpg><h2 id=h-future-and-lori-harvey-dated-for-two-years>Future and Lori Harvey dated for two years</h2><p id=par-4_43>Harvey and Future were first linked in December 2018. The now 37-year-old rapper hinted that he’d connected with the 24-year old former equestrian. However, she never confirmed a thing. The next year, rumors swirled again when the duo was spotted vacationing together.</p><p id=par-5_50>However, it wasn’t until January 2020 amid Harvey’s 23rd birthday that the pair went Instagram official. It was even rumored that the duo had moved in together in LA. However, the romance faded soon after that. Amid their on-again, off-again relationship, the rapper continued to have children with other women.</p><p id=par-6_30>He also became embattled in a court battle with a woman named Eliza Reign. Since then, DNA has confirmed that the rapper is, in fact, the father of Reign’s daughter.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><h2 id=h-future-and-lori-harvey-broke-up-in-2020>Future and Lori Harvey broke up in 2020</h2><p id=par-7_49>By August 2020, Future had deleted all of his photos of Harvey along with many others from his Instagram page. For her part, Harvey barely acknowledged her relationship with the rapper in the first place and continued to post stunning photos of herself with her family and friends.</p><p id=par-8_33>With the baby mama drama, the perceived infidelity, the massive age difference, and the fact that their relationship had become a public spectacle, it appeared that things had simply run their course.</p><p id=par-9_21>However, according to Future’s new music, he might have been more upset about the breakup than most people initially realized.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-3></figure><h2 id=h-future-just-shaded-lori-harvey-in-a-song>Future just shaded Lori Harvey in a song</h2><p id=par-10_49>A portion of Future’s new single just dropped online, and the rapper references Harvey in a way that makes it clear that he’s still in his feelings about their split. In the song, the rapper first sings, “Then it’s over,” before rapping, “Tell Steve Harvey I don’t want her.”</p><p id=par-11_33>Since Steve Harvey is Lori Harvey’s father, fans immediately assumed that Future was throwing shade at his ex. The song might not have been the first reference about Harvey that Future made.</p><p id=par-12_25>Just before the snippet from the single leaked, the rapper retweeted a tweet that read, “(Respect to all women) I BOUGHT THAT B**** A PATEK.”</p><p id=par-13_18>At this point, Harvey hasn’t responded to the new song, and it’s doubtful that she ever will.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGSztsDUq5xmq5iWsaawjKWmq6Fdna6zwsSyZKynnpx7qcDMpWY%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
