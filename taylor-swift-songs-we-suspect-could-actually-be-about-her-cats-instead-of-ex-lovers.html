But Taylor Swift songs could actually be about her cats and not ex-boyfriends if we analyze the lyrics.</strong></p><p><a href=#>Taylor Swift</a>‘s love for her cats is well known. The <a href=#>music</a> legend has three cats: two Scottish folds named Meredith Grey and Olivia Benson and a Ragdoll named Benjamin Button. Karma, a song from Tay Tay’s 10th album Midnights, proudly boasts the lyrics, “Sweet like honey, karma is a cat/ Purring in my lap ’cause it loves me.” But what if Karma is not the only song that professes her love for cats? A deep dive into her entire discography could show songs where Taylor Swift might have sneaked lyrics about her cats.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/01/GettyImages-1194391140-683x1024.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-taylor-swift-s-hidden-songs-we-suspect-are-actually-about-cats>Taylor Swift’s ‘hidden’ songs we suspect are actually about cats</h2><p>T. Swizzle fans went on a mission to find out songs that could be about her cats on Reddit and the answers are surprising. Heart-wrenching songs like ‘Tolerate It’ could easily be about her cats and not a man, as felines are famous for being brats who do not care about the luxury treatment they get, and Taylor’s cat Meredith is ‘famous’ for ignoring her at every chance.</p><p>Another fan commented that Gorgeous could easily about her cats and not (<a href=#>Joe Alwyn</a>, her former <a href=#>movie</a> star boyfriend.)</p><p>“I sing Gorgeous to my (blue-eyed) cat and can only imagine Taylor sings it to hers as well,” the fan wrote.</p><p>“It’s Nice to have a friend,” a song about the <a href=#>celebrity</a>‘s high school love, could be loosely interpreted as a tribute to her cats as they have been constants in her life more than any love interest.</p><p>Trouble is also a strong contender, where she wrote: “I guess you didn’t care/ And I guess I liked that.” Cat owners can relate.</p><p>In I Know Places, she sings, “And they’ll be chasing their tails tryin’ to track us down,” and fans are not sure if she is talking about a guy or actually about her cats and the lyrics are quite literal.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/01/Screenshot-2024-01-19-at-10.03.50 PM-1024x614.png><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-opposite-point-of-view>“The opposite point of view”</h3><p>One of the songs that deserve a mention is I Did Something Bad.</p><p>Taylor sings: “They say I did something bad/ But why’s it feel so good?/ Most fun I ever had/ And I’d do it over and over and over again if I could/ It just felt so good, good.”</p><p>Any cat owner can attest to the lyrics saying it would be their cat’s perspective for sure. Just think of the fallen glasses on the floor after your furry friend pushed it off the table.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-meredith-is-the-culprit>Meredith is the culprit</h3><p>Meredith has a reputation in Swiftie fandom for being the most unhinged cat of all time.</p><p>Fans think the lyrics: “Didn’t you flash your green eyes at me? Haven’t you heard what becomes of curious minds,” in Tay’s Wonderland could be about Meredith who has green eyes.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-all-too-well>All Too Well</h3><p>Swifties have long speculated that <a href=#>All Too Well</a> is written about the hitmaker’s ex Jake Gyllenhaal. But the line “But maybe this thing was a masterpiece, ’til you tore it all up,” could be relatable to cat owners as well over the daily violence that takes place in their own homes.</p><p>No toilet paper is safe.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-everything-has-changed>Everything has changed</h3><p>The heart-piercing lyrics of Everything Has Changed speak to cat moms and dads. Especially when she sings, “Cause all I know is we said, “Hello.” And your eyes look like coming home. All I know is a simple name, everything has changed.”</p><p>The list of Tay Tay sneaking lyrics about her cats could be never-ending and cat lovers are hoping, Reputation’s Taylor Version could easily <a href=#>have a song or two in the vault</a> that is actually about her cats and their rage.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlpX2aGcMDAsqOoql2oxKqy02aqqKaXqHq4sYysrKyolZjBbq%2FOrqOdZZGYwbaty6WwZpqVYq6ju9StZKGdomKwosDSZqCnq6SarqV5zp9knrBdoby3sdGsZg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
