According to the company’s website, passengers are permitted to have one pet with them in the cabin, with a maximum of two animals on any flight.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/01/31/a8965e68-d0bb-45ca-9cf1-b9eb78a479dc_bbd9f86a.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Star Flyer’s rules require that a pet remain in a crate and be assigned a seat alongside its owner in the rearmost seat rows. It charges 50,000 yen (US$340) for a seat occupied by a pet.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Although JAL and ANA both previously permitted animals to travel in their cabins, the airlines said they discontinued those policies in large part due to customer feedback.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Passengers were in the past allowed to take their pets into the cabin, but we received many negative comments from other passengers about allergic reactions, while others complained about the smell and excessive noise and barking,” said JAL spokeswoman Saiko Kuwasaki.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Did human error cause deadly Tokyo plane crash?

Some people have small cats or dogs, but what happens when someone wants to bring their pet snake aboard? Or a lizard? These people could complain that their pets are being treated unfairly.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Permitting passengers to have their pets in the cabin could also threaten the swift evacuation of an aircraft in the event of an accident, Aoki said, noting that the JAL crew members had been praised for efficiently helping passengers escape before the jet burst into flames at Haneda.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">‘I thought we wouldn’t survive’: how 367 fliers were saved from Japan jet blaze</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Pets inside a container are considered to be baggage, and it is forbidden for a passenger to attempt to leave an aircraft that has been involved in an accident with any baggage,” he said. “That means if someone has to leave the aircraft, they cannot take their pet with them.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I do not think most pet owners would follow that rule, so there is a serious risk associated with allowing animals on planes.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kxKaxymaYrKGRZLKku82opKKbo2Sus8DInKOeZ2NngnF%2FlWxmo5mglrturciro6Kmlah6s7HFrqqeZZGhubDDjKmcratdmK6jtc1mm56roJ7BpnnAp6CmmZyoeqe1xKuwZpyVlsGpv4ytpqSxn2Kws63SoQ%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
