The iconic “Oh” songstress is the proud mom of Future, Sienna and Win.</p><p>The star experienced motherhood for the first time when she welcomed her eldest child, Future, alongside her then-fiancé, rapper <strong>Future</strong>, in 2014. The former couple had their son just a few months before calling off their engagement.</p><p>The “Goodies” singer turned her heartbreak into happiness when she met NFL quarterback <strong>Russell&nbsp;Wilson</strong> just two years later. Ciara and the handsome hunk tied the knot in 2016 and expanded her family when they welcomed their daughter, Sienna, the following year in 2017. The Grammy winner also gave birth to the pair’s youngest son, Win, in July 2020.</p><p>Now that she has a full house, Ciara couldn’t be happier about raising her adorable kiddos. The “I Love Myself” singer revealed she actually “changed for the better” the moment she became a mom.</p><p>“It’s made me not sweat the small stuff. I think [being a mom] gives you more compassion in life, and more love in your heart,” Ciara gushed to <a href=#>W Magazine</a> in 2018. “I have to say, I do love giving love, but I want to give more. There’s nothing sweeter than putting a smile on your kid’s face.”</p><p>While she’s always under the spotlight, the entertainer learned to balance her career and keeping her kids happy. “I think the biggest thing is making life as normal as possible and making sure that they’re having the best opportunity at life and being able to do all that they aspire to do; [giving them] the support system they need to be who they are and find their own voice,” she told the outlet. “That’s really important to our family.”</p><p>Ciara also found a way to appreciate all the time off she has with her family. “As an entertainer when you’re just going and going, and with business when you’re really driven, you take [moments] to put all of that to the side and really be normal and embrace special [parts] of life,” she gushed to <a href=#>ESSENCE</a> in 2018.</p><p><strong>Scroll through the gallery below to learn more about Ciara’s three kids, Future, Sienna and Win!</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46coJqqkWK4qrDSZqSenaRiwamxjKygp5%2BVp8Bur8eio52qlaN8</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
