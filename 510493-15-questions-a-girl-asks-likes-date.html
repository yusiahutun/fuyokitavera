Therefore, she can ask you a lot of questions, from serious ones with hidden meanings to simple questions that give her an excuse to chat with you. Below is a look at some of these questions and what they might mean:</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/afce4b1d7a65c4d3.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>100+ funny questions to ask a guy to make him laugh out loud</span></p></a><h3>1. Your name and number</h3><p class=align-left>Do you want to know if a girl is into you? Your name is one of the top questions she will ask if she likes you, especially if you've just met. After all, a girl who has no interest in you will not bother to learn your name; they will ignore or avoid you.</p><p class=align-left>A girl who likes you might also ask you for your number. This indicates she is interested in you and wants more interactions with you.</p><h3>2. A lot of questions about who you are</h3><p class=align-left>What does it mean if a girl asks you a lot of questions? A girl who likes you will want to know more about you. She will ask many questions about your background, age, work, favourite food, religion, and more.</p><p class=align-left>These questions signify that she is interested and wants to know you better. Questions are also<a id=https://www.tuko.co.ke/293239-50-conversation-starters-crush.html href=#> good conversation </a>starters; she could ask them to keep talking to you.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/5c9da48cbbdf1276.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>70+ funny and uncomfortable questions to ask a girl you're dating</span></p></a><h3>3. Your star sign</h3><p class=align-left>This is one of the questions a girl asks when she likes you. It might seem weird, but some people measure romantic compatibility with <a href=#>star signs</a>. For others, the zodiac sign is a way to understand their romantic interests better. Either way, asking for a star sign is a huge hint that a girl is interested in you.</p><h3>4. Asking to buy you a drink</h3><p class=align-left>Men are not the only ones who buy their crush drinks; girls do too. So, the next time a girl you like offers to buy you a drink, it might mean she likes you. However, buying you a drink could also be a friendly gesture, especially if you are in a large group and doing rounds.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/afce4b1d7a65c4d3.jpg><h3>5. How are you doing</h3><p class=align-left>What does it mean when a girl asks how you are doing? Asking someone about their well-being can be a sign of interest and affection. It could also be an ice-breaker for starting a conversation.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/aaad724b82a2fce8.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How to ask someone to be your boyfriend without sounding weird</span></p></a><p class=align-left>A girl who regularly asks how youâ€™re doing could be interested in you and looking for something more. That being said, "How are you doing?" is a standard polite greeting among friends.</p><h3>6. How was your day</h3><p class=align-left>Does a girl like you if she asks how your day was? Yes, she likes you. This question is a polite greeting gesture. But if a girl constantly asks you how your day was, this is a green flag that she likes you. She will ask this question because she worries about you or because it is a less awkward way to start a conversation and get you to talk to her.</p><h3>7. If you are dating</h3><p class=align-left>Asking if you are dating is one of the top questions a girl asks when she likes you. It means she is interested in you and wants to know if you are available. She wants a <a href=#>serious relationship </a>with you and will also mention that she is single to let you know she is available.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/0fgjhs20o0f5mb4ci.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>100+ weird questions to ask your boyfriend just for fun</span></p></a><h3>8. The qualities you look for in a girlfriend</h3><p class=align-left>Has a girl you like asked about the type of woman you date? This is one of the top questions a girl can ask a guy she likes. It can mean that she is interested in you and discretely wants to know if she is your type.</p><p class=align-left>Sometimes asking about your type could also be a polite way to start a conversation among friends. Also, she could be asking for a friend she wants to set you up with.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/5c9da48cbbdf1276.jpg><h3>9. Asking for your opinion</h3><p class=align-left>Does a girl you like keep asking for your opinion? This could have very different positive meanings. First, it shows that she respects and values your advice, which is a good sign. It could also be an excuse to talk to you about different things.</p><p class=align-left>Asking for your opinion on her clothes and<a href=#> latest hairstyle</a> is an obvious sign of interest. This is especially the case when she always changes her style to fit the answers you give her, a sign that she wants to impress you.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/275715a268e66083.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>150+ good morning pick-up lines that'll make your crush smile</span></p></a><h3>10. Asking you to hang out</h3><p class=align-left>Asking to hang out is one of the top hints a girl will give when she likes you. This is especially the case when she asks to hang out alone with you and on date-worthy adventures like watching movies, going for coffee or lunch, going for picnics, hiking, and more. Also, asking to hang out could be a discreet way of asking to go out on a date.</p><h3>11. Your hobbies and interests</h3><p class=align-left>If a girl likes you, she will want to know more about you as much as possible. Therefore, asking about hobbies and interests can be another sign that she is into you. She could also ask about them to find out if you have similar<a href=#> hobbies and interests</a> that you can enjoy together.</p><h3>12. Asking about your passions</h3><p class=align-left>Asking about your passion is another hint that she is interested in you. She wants to know you more deeply and understand what drives you. She will also freely share her passions with you so that you can learn more about her.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/f7e69dadcf886282.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How to impress a girl on Instagram chat (with examples)</span></p></a><h3>13.

Your Future Plans</h3><p class=align-left>A girl who wants a relationship with you, especially a long-term one, will want to know where she fits in your future. She may ask many questions about your plans, including marriage, career, and kids. Likewise, she will share her plans with you to give you an insight into where you might fit into her life.</p><h3>15. She'll ask if you like her</h3><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/9fffd8b70b06499c.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>15 different types of girls you'll meet and their personalities</span></p></a><p class=align-left>This is an obvious question a girl will ask when she has a crush on you. This is her way of telling you she is into you and wants something more and her asking you if you want the same. It might also be possible that she suspects your feelings, doesn't feel the same way, and wants to let you down gently.</p><p class=align-left>If you are wondering what to do if a girl asks if you like them, you must answer her honestly. Tell her if you are interested in her and see where things will go. And if you don't like her, let her know gently that you only see her as a friend.</p><h2>Final word</h2><p class=align-left>It's hard to know if a girl is into you. Fortunately, she'll communicate her feelings through non-verbal cues and ask questions. The above are some of the top questions a girl asks when she likes you.
