This is my favorite way to fall into something new: swiftly and static-free, even better when it has outsized pleasing results. I find the energy that comes from it kind of infectious. Why limit this fun to potatoes? Why don’t I do something random and new and unpredictable <i>every single day?</i> I should start right away. Or after I make these potatoes again because the only bad thing about them was that we had plans that night and I left them with the kids and babysitter. I did sneak one off the pan. It was hot. I dropped it. I definitely definitely did not eat it anyway. I am way too classy for that. Totally.</p><p><span id=more-35471></span><br><a title="one-inch slices, just do it" href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm1.staticflickr.com/815/27201920168_b81eed52c9_n.jpg alt="one-inch slices, just do it" width=320 height=213 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><a title="ready to roast" href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm1.staticflickr.com/877/41031625802_20f7979e58_n.jpg alt="ready to roast" width=320 height=213 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><a title="bubbling in the oven" href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm1.staticflickr.com/875/27201919938_141129a254_n.jpg alt="bubbling in the oven" width=320 height=213 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><a title=flipped href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm1.staticflickr.com/880/41031625472_e436bc7de6_n.jpg alt=flipped width=320 height=213 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p>Do you love a circuitous recipe path? Me too. I saw it on the Instagram Stories of <a href=#>Dawn Perry</a>, who is the food director at <a href=#>Real Simple</a>, and it seems to have been discovered by associate food editor Grace Elkus, who found it on Pinterest, where it is <a href=#>very, very popular</a>. It feels like a pared-down version of fondant potatoes (<i>pommes de terres fondantes</i>), a French dish in which cylinders of potato are browned very slowly in butter, with stock added in increments until the potatoes are crisp on top but creamy inside, but also somewhat glazed and booming with flavor. [Also, I love any dish that allows us to apply high praise usually reserved for meat, i.e. “meltingly tender”, to a vegetable.]</p><p><a title="ready to eat" href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm1.staticflickr.com/820/41031625162_e3d5d9f929_z.jpg alt="ready to eat" width=640 height=427 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p>The Pinterest-favorite version that I’ve riffed on here happens in an oven instead of on the stove, meaning it’s fairly hands-off, ideal for people who plan to use their <a href=#>hands</a> to make a big salad to offset the fact that they want to eat the whole pan of them and not share with anyone. The heat will seem too high, the butter too brown, the color on the potatoes too dark, and then you’ll try them and wonder why you’d serve anything else with — or instead of! — a roast ever again.</p><p><a title="melting potatoes" href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm1.staticflickr.com/812/27201919058_534eb7d0b7_z.jpg alt="melting potatoes" width=640 height=427 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p>* Thank you for all of your kind words this week.

But I’m <a href=#>reading here</a> that floury/mealy potatoes (such as Russets) are often called for too. I haven’t tested it with them, so if you try them, let us know. I imagine they’d absorbed the broth even more luxuriously. I used all butter but I have read that olive oil with a little butter to finish, and/or clarified butter are equally popular, and less prone to burning. But I don’t think you should skimp on the fat. If you do, you’re going to eat roasted potatoes with broth, basically, and not roasted potatoes in a reduction of deeply browned butter and concentrated stock infused with herbs and garlic and I don’t know how you’re still reading this. Go! Make these now!<ul><li class="jetpack-recipe-ingredient p-ingredient ingredient" itemprop=recipeIngredient>4 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted</li><li class="jetpack-recipe-ingredient p-ingredient ingredient" itemprop=recipeIngredient>2 teaspoons chopped fresh thyme or rosemary leaves (I skipped because mine are under snow)</li><li class="jetpack-recipe-ingredient p-ingredient ingredient" itemprop=recipeIngredient>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li><li class="jetpack-recipe-ingredient p-ingredient ingredient" itemprop=recipeIngredient>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li><li class="jetpack-recipe-ingredient p-ingredient ingredient" itemprop=recipeIngredient>2 pounds yukon gold potatoes, peeled, cut into 1-inch slices</li><li class="jetpack-recipe-ingredient p-ingredient ingredient" itemprop=recipeIngredient>1 cup chicken or vegetable stock or low-sodium broth</li><li class="jetpack-recipe-ingredient p-ingredient ingredient" itemprop=recipeIngredient>3 to 4 garlic cloves, peeled and smashed</li></ul>Heat oven to 500 degrees F.<p>[This is really, crazy hot. If you’re really nervous, I suppose that 450 degrees or 475 will also work, but I made it both times at 500 without problems.]</p><p>Place melted butter in the bottom of a large bowl. Stir in herbs, if using, salt, and pepper. Add potato slices and mix to evenly coat them. Spread potato slices and all of the good stuff at the bottom of the bowl in a 9×13 (quarter-sheet) metal (a glass baking dish shouldn’t be used at this high of a temperature) baking pan.</p><p>Roast potatoes for 15 minutes. Use a thin spatula (you all know by now how much I love a flexible fish <a href=#>spatula</a>, especially here) to loosen potatoes and turn them over. Roast for a second 15 minutes, then carefully pour stock or broth into pan and add the garlic cloves. Roast for 15 minutes more, until potatoes are fully tender.</p><p>Remove from oven. Transfer to a serving platter along with any remaining liquid in pan and serve warm to very lucky people.</p><h3 class=sd-title>Share this:</h3><ul><li class=share-twitter><a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-shared=sharing-twitter-35471 class="share-twitter sd-button share-icon" href=# title="Click to share on Twitter"><span>Twitter</span></a></li><li class=share-facebook><a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-shared=sharing-facebook-35471 class="share-facebook sd-button share-icon" href=# title="Click to share on Facebook"><span>Facebook</span></a></li><li class=share-email><a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-shared class="share-email sd-button share-icon" href=# title="Click to email a link to a friend" data-email-share-error-title="Do you have email set up?" data-email-share-error-text="If you're having problems sharing via email, you might not have email set up for your browser.
