These precious father-son moments include praying in church, singing the National Anthem before a baseball game, working out, bonding over a beverage and even a shaving lesson.</p><p>“Yeah, in my soul, one thing I know / I ain't lookin' for a pot of gold / That ain't what this life means to me / I keep my head up high, feet on the ground / Love the ones I'm living 'round / Life is just that simple to me / Yeah, I'm a rich man,” LBT’s Jimi Westbrook reflects in the chorus over gently-strummed acoustic guitar chords and a brisk production.</p><p>“‘Rich Man’ has a special place in my heart, and I’ve been touched by the response it’s gotten from the record and playing it on the road. We wanted the video to show the love of family, and love of a father," shares Westbrook, who wrote the song by himself.</p><p>"This song makes me think of my own dad, and I wanted to honor that as well as the heart I have for my son," he adds. "Making this with Charles, the other actors, and of course Karen, Kimberly, and Phillip, was really a labor of love.”</p><p>Says&nbsp;LBT’s Karen Fairchild: “‘Rich Man’ tells the story of how the deep roots of family ground us and give us the space to flourish and become who we are meant to be. True wealth is the story of this song.”</p><p>“Rich Man” is off the Grammy, ACM, CMA, AMA and Emmy-winning group’s 10th album, <a href=#>Mr. Sun.</a> The 16-song collection includes its buoyant singalong lead single, "<a href=#>Hell Yeah</a>."</p><h2 class=photogallery-title>Top 22 Country Songs of 2022, Ranked</h2>There are plenty of feel-good country jams on this list of the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">top country songs of 2022</a>, but the No. 1 song is one of the best love songs of the decade. These 22 songs are ranked by critical acclaim, radio and sales success, and importance to the genre.Seven of the 22 artists made our <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Top Country Songs list from 2021</a>, as well, but there are no song repeats.

So, before you ask where your favorite song is (i.e. Cody Johnson, "'Til You Can't"), be sure the miss isn't just a technicality.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmpaGkqbmmecGinmasn6y7br7InJ9mpZGjere1w56mZpuYlr%2BtsdJmnKyslaN8</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
