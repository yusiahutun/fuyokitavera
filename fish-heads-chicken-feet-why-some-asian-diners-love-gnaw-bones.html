I would go further and say the really masculine real men also gnaw on gristle and bones.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">There’s nothing more primal than eating a roast chicken with your hands, tearing off the legs and wings and using your teeth to get all the meat from the bones. It’s almost as satisfying as digging into a plate of barbecued ribs with the sauce staining your fingernails, or attacking every crevice of a lobster, so you can suck out the tasty green tomalley.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Eating has always been one of life’s great tactile and sensual pleasures. Think of all those portraits of English king Henry VIII, where he’s holding his giant turkey leg. But somewhere in the course of Western society’s prudish progress, it was decided genteel people shouldn’t touch their food. Proper, civilised behaviour meant that using utensils was the correct way to eat.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">So, we dress up and gentrify our sustenance as etiquette demands. Fine cuisine isn’t devoured but nibbled on. Fish is filleted, meat is trimmed and deboned, even the skin on potatoes and fruit has to be removed for sanitised consumption.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2019/10/16/9dae86e8-ee6a-11e9-9f3d-785f2d889e39_1320x770_102336.jpg>The only exception is casual food like <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">chicken wings</span></a>. But seeing how much wing meat people sometimes leave on the bones, it seems they just don’t want to get their fingers dirty.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">At the risk of making broad racial generalisations, that’s the difference between Asian and Caucasian dining.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2019/10/16/e63d7d42-ef14-11e9-9f3d-785f2d889e39_972x_102336.JPG>Western palates don’t have the love for textures that Asian eaters enjoy. This is why we eat chicken feet, tendon and jellyfish. We like gooey, chewy and other unusual textures, from <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">fish maw</span></a> to soft pork bones.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">We delight in the challenge and work of picking flesh from the carcass. We see a fish head and think, “Yum, can’t wait to braise that thing in curry and suck it clean.” To us, true gastronomic appreciation is chewing the fat, licking the skin, jawing on tendon and cartilage, then spitting the bones out on the table.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">When I lived in Canada, the local KFC loved my uncle because whenever he ordered a bucket, he always demanded “no breast meat”. The manager happily obliged because everybody else wanted the breast. My uncle hated the dry and bland white meat, which had little of that secret herbs and spices coating. The bony dark meat had the delicious crispy batter stuck all around.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2019/10/16/a2d500ac-ee6a-11e9-9f3d-785f2d889e39_1320x770_102336.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Admittedly, not all Asian diners fit this mould. Mughal chefs in India created a royal kebab called galouti, where the meat is minced so finely that chewing was unnecessary. It was considered luxury for the nobility of the time.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In many cultures, it is the poor who are the true pioneers of nose-to-nail dining. It certainly wasn’t a rich guy who first cooked cod sperm or marinated duck tongue, or who turned a pig’s snout into a terrine. Eating the more unusual cuts of meat came about through poverty.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">When you see a fried shrimp head on a Japanese plate, it’s not meant to be decoration. You’re supposed to eat it. Really good chefs will skilfully fry prawn shells so you can crunch the whole exoskeleton. That’s why they season the outside of a shrimp.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2019/10/16/f6bfbd4a-ee67-11e9-9f3d-785f2d889e39_972x_102336.JPG>The one line I draw when it comes to gnarly dining is crab. The meat might be sweeter than lobster and langoustines but rarely do I order crab in a restaurant. To honour the decapod, you should extract every last bit of its flesh. However, I find a delicacy like <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">hairy crab</span></a> just too tedious and messy, requiring too much work for too little return. At home, I might consume hairy crab at a leisurely pace, but it’s far too time-consuming at a restaurant in front of friends.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">What can I say, real men can sometimes be real lazy.</p><p>This article appeared in the South China Morning Post print edition as: Why real men, and most Asians, gnaw on bones and gristle</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuaqyxKyrsqSVZLOwu8Nmm6uhnqB8or7TopqlnV9ofXR%2Fj2tuaJ6ZqLVutMSam6xlk522pLfEp2SfnZWperi02GaqqKWVYq60tcCnZJ2hnpq%2FtHnLqK2eZZejrrh5wailnqs%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
