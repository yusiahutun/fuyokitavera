Now, she's over it and done trying. "I have no guilt," she said.</p><p>As Joe Gorga and his sister got into yet another screaming match during the three-part "RHONJ" reunion special -- she called him a "bitch boy" and said he was "too involved" in the drama between the women -- Joe at one point stormed off the set and said he was done, he was quitting the series.</p><p>During the podcast, Melissa recalled how excited she was to get to spend time away from all the nonsense (yeah, right!) during the "Ultimate GIrls Trip" series. "This is exciting that we get to do this together and this is something fun," she recalled telling Teresa. "We'll have these memories that we did something fun for when we get older."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:026da224-7f0d-4664-9f34-b92d8e3851ae data-container-ref=toofab:article:0aaf69a9-5f30-4230-bb5c-297e253f722e data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=29><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/45/5by4/2022/05/11/450bfbba8cd745dabc7948d24e09732c_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Andy Cohen Tells Everyone to 'Shut Up' on RHONJ Reunion, Snaps at Teresa for 'Demeaning' Joe</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>In response, though, she said Teresa just rolled her eyes. "Between that and watching this season, I just feel like I tried and I’m good," she explained.</p><p>As far as she's concerned, she put in the effort and it clearly just isn't going to happen, and that's just the way it is. "It's okay to say that we don’t have the best relationship," she explained. "And I don't feel guilty saying that because I tried really hard and know that I tried hard ... for my in-laws and for Joe."</p><p>Tension had been rising between Melissa, Joe and Teresa since Teresa revealed that she didn't want Melissa to stand as her maid-of-honor in her upcoming wedding, but she did ask her fiancé Luis Ruelas's sisters to fill that role instead. During the reunion, the in-laws made a pact to stop pretending to like one another, which Melissa said helps her feel "a little free."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:a45ad196-d518-4f38-923d-859c9acf05d5 data-container-ref=toofab:article:0aaf69a9-5f30-4230-bb5c-297e253f722e data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/c4/5by4/2022/04/20/c4fefc1004f840818e4e3b708e92aab9_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Charles Sykes / Bravo / Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Melissa Gorga Reveals Where She Stands with Teresa Giudice Amid Her Feud with Margaret</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>On Melissa's <a href=#>"On Display"</a> podcast, Joe said he's over Teresa seemingly being angry at him and Melissa for being a part of "RHONJ," calling it "absurd." In fact, he thinks she should show a little appreciation that her brother helped her out during some financial hardship when Teresa's ex, Joe Giudice, was unemployed and Teresa was in prison.</p><p>"When she was in prison, Joe wasn't working at all, either. So they had no income," Joe said. "If we weren't on the show, their kids would not still be living in that house and have food and have whatever they had." They said they gave Joe Giudice someone to interact with while Teresa was away.</p><p>At the same time, Melissa said that she'd be happy to never talk about this family feud again, and believes the cast and audience probably feel the same way. "Does anybody really wanna see Teresa, Melissa and Joe argue and make up to break up?" she mused on "Mention It All."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:7726d201-2e0a-4238-9a7f-70fb0fd78ca5 data-container-ref=toofab:article:0aaf69a9-5f30-4230-bb5c-297e253f722e data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/7d/5by4/2022/03/16/7de78a3d95364691b11a42da93971d03_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Bravo</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Teresa Giudice's Fiancé Luis Ruelas Denies Abusing Ex In Front of Her Kids on RHONJ</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>"I don't care if we never talk about it again," she continued. "I don't want to talk about Teresa or the family, never again if it was up to me."</p><p>But that's not to say Melissa wants to quit the show. In fact, she thinks someone else might be ready to do that. "I do think that she's come to a point where she doesn't enjoy it anymore and it's very obvious that she doesn't enjoy it," Melissa told <a href=#>"The Wendy Williams Show"</a> earlier this month.</p><p>"She doesn't want to do a lot of the activities that we do. She didn't want to sing with us. She didn't want to climb the trees with us. She kind of rolls her eyes to everything so I think that if it is making her unhappy and she has a guy who's financially stable and they want to be happy, then she should do that," she continued. "Why do this if you don't need to?"</p><a id=gallery-link-4f07726a-fcdd-4155-8a32-5f04e7440500 class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:4f07726a-fcdd-4155-8a32-5f04e7440500 data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:0aaf69a9-5f30-4230-bb5c-297e253f722e data-gallery-layout=carousel><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/3f/4by3/2022/05/16/3f9e65b249c14ce68cf80624a707c3cf_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3N7j25mam9forKttdKsmGafn6e0onnNqGSgrZmhwW6v1K2roqaXYsGqsdJmq56qlaiubrPIrpuim5Vk</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
