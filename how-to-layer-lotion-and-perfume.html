But it turns out that when you know what you’re doing, layering scented body <a href=# id=auto-tag_lotion data-tag=lotion>lotion</a> and <a href=# id=auto-tag_perfume data-tag=perfume>perfume</a> is actually a genius move. To learn the dos and don’ts of how to layer lotion and perfume, we went to fragrance experts and picked up a few interesting tips along the way.</p><p><strong>It won’t just intensify it.<br></strong>At first, we thought putting on scented lotion and perfume would be a train-wreck waiting to happen. No one wants to walk into a room and overwhelm her colleagues with a cloud of hydrangea. <b>Steven Claisse, </b>Senior <span id=0.2717838137622288 class=highlight>Perfume</span>r at Takasago and p<span id=0.3910278356271297 class=highlight>erfume</span>r of various <a href=# id=auto-tag_clean data-tag=clean>CLEAN</a> Fragrances, explains that layering these two fragrance-filled objects won’t intensify the smell, but complement different notes. In fact, Claisse says that lotion under perfume is a good way to introduce layering in general.&nbsp;Good to know when you receive those gift sets&nbsp;around the holidays.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/gucci-beauty.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/beyonce-perfume.png><p><strong>It makes it last.</strong><br>If you feel like fragrance always evaporates into thin air the second you put it on your skin, layering is going to be a godsend. <strong>Chris Wyatt</strong>, Executive Director of Global Education at <a href=# id=auto-tag_jo-malone data-tag=jo-malone>Jo Malone</a>, tells us that it will help you keep your scent stick around longer, which we definitely appreciate. “<span lang=en-us>Fragrance layering is the best way to make your scent last longer using,” he says. “For example, if <strong>Pomegranate Noir</strong> ($124, <a href=# rel=nofollow>jomalone.com</a>) is your scent of choice, you can add Pomegranate Noir Bath Oil to your morning bath.”</span></p><p><strong>Apply Your Lotion First<br></strong>Do you apply your moisturizer after your shower? Good—that’s exactly the way you should be doing it. “I recommend putting the lotion on first then shortly after misting on the fragrance,” explains Claisse. “You will have a great fragrance base with just the lotion and a complimentary mist of scent to enhance the fragrance experience.”<strong><br></strong></p><p><strong>Know What Compliments Each Other</strong><br>When it comes to the layering process, you have to pick <a href=# id=auto-tag_scents data-tag=scents>scents</a> that work well together. Claisse says to try slathering on a floral body lotion and spritzing on a musky scent, like<strong> CLEAN White Woods</strong> ($38, <a href=# rel=nofollow>sephora.com</a>) to make it a bit deeper, richer and sexier. In general, you should always layer a light scent with one that’s stronger. Here’s a quick cheat sheet of the fragrance types that work best together:<br>Musk and Floral<br>Oriental and Fruity<br>Oriental and Gourmand<br>Citrus and Woody<br>Fruity and Floral<br>Floral and Oriental</p><p>If you’re interested in learning more about layering lotion and fragrance, <a href=# rel=nofollow>Jo Malone</a> even offers a feature on their website that walks you through what products go well together, based on if you want your scent to smell fresher or warmer. In fact, Wyatt tells us that their fragrances are specifically made so that clashing isn’t really a concern. “The Jo Malone London signature is fragrances that are simple yet sophisticated in their composition, he says. “There is clarity in the way they are created, allowing them to stay true to their ingredients, and the result is that all combine well with another.”</p><p><strong>Know What Not to Layer<br></strong>You’ll want to keep green florals and and oriental fragrances separate, explains Steven. “These tend to clash,” he says. “They are overly juxtaposed and will likely produce a scent that is very discorded.” And while we like interesting scents, discordant fragrance is never&nbsp;one of our perfume goals.</p><p><strong>More From Daily Makeover: <a href=#>A Game-Changing Perfume</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57wZ6YrqypZMCstc1mmpqqlWSCd4CQbWdooJ%2BserW7jKWYsp2iYrmwwMiopWaZnpl6sbHRn6ymnV8%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
