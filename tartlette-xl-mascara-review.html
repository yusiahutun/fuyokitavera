So many new formulas have come out, and of course I’ve tried them all. One stand out mascara “type” — yes there are types! — that I can’t get enough of is tubing <a href=#>mascara</a>. If you’re unfamiliar, tubing mascaras create actual tube extensions on your individual lashes, meaning they appear longer, more fanned out, and more gorgeous than ever. To remove the tubes at the end of the day, all you have to do is slide them off your lashes with warm water.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/anua-cleansing-oil-tiktok.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Outlander.jpg><p>And although this removal process is much easier than scrubbing off waterproof formulas, the best part of tubing mascara is that most formulas are usually water-resistant, like this <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Tartlette XL mascara</a> that’s exclusive to <a href=# id=auto-tag_qvc data-tag=qvc>QVC</a>. So in addition to tubing mascara being automatically lengthening, since it’s water-resistant, it won’t smudge or flake off over time, which is usually my biggest mascara conundrum. This formula is way less flakier than the original Tartlette formula. Both of them definitely have minimal flakes, but I’m always looking for completely flake-free formulas, and this Tartlette XL formula is as close as I’ve gotten with any Tarte mascara formula.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Screenshot-2024-02-27-at-5.09.42-PM.png><p>I mean, seriously, just look at my lashes after applying!! As I was reading the reviews on the QVC page, I noticed a lot of reviewers saying the mascara came out way too thick or clumpy upon first application. This is a mascara issue that I’ve thought A LOT ABOUT. Usually, when you break open a new tube, there is tons of formula packed onto the brush that’s gathered there during the shipping process.</p><p>I find that it’s best to keep your OLD mascara wand nearby and once you apply the new formula to lashes, get your older wand and help remove some of the product/fan out the product even further. After a few weeks of use, your <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">new mascara wand </a>will adjust and you can put on a more even application. Yes, it’s annoying, but it literally happens with ALL mascaras, so the next time you deal with this, remember my helpful hint.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Screenshot-2024-02-28-at-10.45.34-AM.png><p>Tarlette XL Mascara (2 Pack)</p><p>Without mascara, my lashes are naturally long and thick, but they stick straight out instead of curling upward, so it usually looks like I have no lashes at all if I’m not wearing anything on them.</p><p>Check out my before and after with the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Tartlette XL </a>below. It’s seriously like night and day! I love that this formula is buildable and helps my lashes curl upwards. Plus, even on my longest nights out, I look in the mirror and don’t notice huge smudges under my eyes. That’s seriously a win for a heavy mascara girl like me.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/before-after.jpg><p>If you’re unfamiliar with shopping at QVC or it’s your first time, you can score $10 off of your first purchase of $25 or more with the code WELCOME24. Since you get two mascaras for just $37 with this deal, that means the coupon applies. It’s basically like spending $27 on two mascaras that are going to last you for the rest of the year. That’s a serious win; make sure to take advantage of this deal ASAP.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57wZ6YrqypZLqit8Sup2hpZ2eBdIOXaKuaqqShsrXAxGavpWWdlsCkrdGaZKudpp6yuHs%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
