For over a decade I have been a Wet Brush devotee. Recently, I noticed that a new brush, the <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">FHI Heat UnBrush</a>, was creating some major buzz on TikTok, to the tune of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nocaes>1.1 billion views</a>. I immediately asked Los Angeles hair god, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel=nocaes>Sean James</a>, to dish on the viral brush, which is basically the Stanley cup of hair brushes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Once you experience <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">the magic of the UnBrush</a>, you’ll never want to go back to anything else,” James, of The Matthew Preece Salon in Santa Monica, gushed over “the incredible brush” he has been telling all of his clients — including Jamie Lee Curtis and Cole Sprouse — about. “The brush gently and effortlessly extracts knots and tangles from even the most unruly hair without any pain.” An ultra-light, high-performance handle makes it super lightweight, while 105 dual length bristles work through both wet and dry hair with ease, he says. ICYMI, FHI Heat is the same company that makes some of the top-rated hair dryers, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>straightening and curling irons</a>, and other hair care essentials.&nbsp;</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span></figure><figure id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Since “unruly” is the perfect adjective to describe my long, wavy hair, I immediately Googled the wonder brush, and learned that it costs just $18 and comes in pretty much every color imaginable, with 28 options on Amazon. That’s not bad for a brush that TikTokers are hailing as “magic.”&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In one <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>viral TikTok video</a> with 1.9 million likes, Shanlei Pearl, who has 4C hair, puts the UnBrush to the test to see if the brush could “detangle what is basically dreadlocks at this point,” and guess what? The UnBrush got the job done. “So I get it now,” she says, referring to the hype. “But yeah, I’ve never had a brush this good in my life.” In another video, a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nocaes>TikToker</a> who describes her long hair as “tangled” and “curly,” uses the UnBrush to detangle her seriously knotty strands — in just seconds.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">People with hair types ranging from curly to fine rave <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">about the UnBrush on Amazon</a>, where it is currently the best-selling brush on the entire website. The retailer also notes that more than 10,000 people have purchased it in the last month alone. <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">One reviewer</a> with “long, fine, perpetually-tangled” hair called the UnBrush “magic” after initially having “serious” doubts. “It goes all the way through my hair to my scalp, and does a little massage along the way,” they wrote, adding that “it reaches through all the layers” of their hair “at once.” “I have naturally curly hair and it goes through it like butter,” said another <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Amazon shopper</a>, who called it “unbelievable.”&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">To give you an idea how game-changing a brush can be, many parents also maintain that the brush is a serious “<a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">life saver</a>” — even for kids who “scream and cry” when it comes time to brush hair. One parent called it the “<a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">best brush ever</a>” after being “very skeptical” about the hype. “My daughter always cries and complains when I brush her hair but tried this today and was quick and tear free.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">James and several of the TikTokers who are part of the UnBrush fan club just have one warning: Beware of dupes. Apparently there are lots of imitators on the market, so make sure you order a brush that’s <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">shipped and sold by Amazon</a>.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span></figure><figure id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57xaGgZqCVlsFuwc2bqa6rmGK1orXRZpmrraOderW1yq2mpGVoaoJ0f5Bv</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
