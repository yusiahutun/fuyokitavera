They pretended to be clergymen and convinced Stayner, who was seven years old at the time, to get inside the van by telling him, “Your parents no longer want you.”</p><p>The new docuseries begins with Steven’s kidnapping in 1972 and follows him as he is abused by Yosemite Lodge employee Kenneth Parnell. Stayner would not be seen again until 1980 when he fled Parnell to save Timothy White, another kidnapped boy. Stayner, at 14 years old, had had enough of seeing White mourn for his family for two weeks. “I was not going to let that child go through what I had already gone through,” he said emphatically. Stayner’s high school sweetheart, Lori Duke, told ABC News, “And if I didn’t take care of it now, it would just get&nbsp;worse.”</p><p>Stayner’s reappearance catapulted him into the spotlight, and he later starred in the 1989 television film I Know My First Name Is Steven.</p><p>From here on you’ll learn about Steven’s son and other family members. So, keep reading.</p><h3><strong>Meet Steven Stayner Jr, Steven Stayner Son</strong></h3><p>Steven Stayner Jr. is the son of Steven Stayner.
