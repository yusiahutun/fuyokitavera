Doja’s posts included her <a href=#>refusing to tell her fans on social media</a> she “loved” them as well as responding with “ew” when it came to her fan base’s name. On the Live videos, she was recorded telling people “you sound crazy’, but she says this was her sense of humor. She explained her posts on <a href=#>Instagram</a>‘s sister app were ‘memes.’</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/12/GettyImages-1362171352-683x1024.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-doja-cat-s-fan-controversy>Doja Cat’s fan controversy</h2><p>The <a href=#>celebrity</a> has been caught up in many different disputes over her career, especially in the last couple of years. But her latest attack seemed to cut deeply among her fans. On META’s rival app to X (formerly <a href=#>Twitter</a>), she put up a variety of posts which upset fans so much, those with accounts dedicated to Doja, deactivated them.</p><p>Doja, whose birth name is Amala Ratna Zandile Dlamini, began responding to fans in July with passive comments about them, herself, and the relationship between them.</p><p><strong>MORE:</strong> <a href=#>Madonna proudly shows off new ‘boyfriend’ Josh Popper onstage despite 35-year age gap</a></p><p>“Nobody forced you [to be a fan],” she said in one post. “Idk why you’re talking to me like you’re my mother b****. You sound like a crazy person.” In another, she told a fan: “Just delete the entire account and rethink everything it’s never too late” after they asked what they should change their username to because of her earlier response to her fans’ nickname.</p><p>“I don’t though cuz I don’t even know y’all,” she said after someone asked her to say she loved her followers. When shown a screenshot of a post she made previously about getting fans to choose between two nicknames, including Kittens (which won) she responded: “Ew.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-doja-responds-to-the-backlash>Doja responds to the backlash</h2><p>In a new interview with Apple Music’s podcast host Ebro Darden, she <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">explained</a>: “One thing that I do want to set straight is that you’ll never see a direct quote of me saying, ‘I hate my fans.’ Not once. But it’s a really big misquoted thing where everybody is saying, she hates her fans.”</p><p>The 28-year-old continued: “I don’t need to have to explain my sense of humor or explain comedy to anyone. If people don’t see the joke, then they just don’t see the joke. It’s not my responsibility to have them understand.”</p><p>She <a href=# rel=nofollow>said</a> in a previous interview, people on the internet “kind of take ownership over that person” if they don’t know them personally.</p><p>“My theory is that if someone has never met me in real life, then, subconsciously, I’m not real to them. So when people become engaged with someone they don’t even know on the internet, they kind of take ownership over that person. They think that person belongs to them in some sense.</p><p>“And when that person changes drastically, there is a shock response that is almost uncontrollable… I’ve accepted that that’s what happens.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-trying-to-leave-the-narrative-doja-has-created-for-herself>Trying to leave the ‘narrative’ Doja has created for herself</h2><p>The Kiss Me More rapper said she is “way too f***ing famous” and is “doing what she can to “separate myself from this narrative.”</p><p>“I’m doing what I can slowly but surely to separate myself from this narrative or whatever this world is that I built,” she explained. “I’m fine-tuning it and tailoring it to what I want out of it.</p><p>“I feel like it doesn’t matter what you say, it doesn’t matter what some people know.&nbsp;I don’t need to explain myself, I don’t. I don’t need to prove myself to a bunch of people who are just going to project no matter what I say too. There’s people who are incredibly dogmatic.</p><p>“It doesn’t matter what the f*** you do, what you say make, they’re always going to stand by, that person’s evil.&nbsp;Or, that person’s this or that person’s that.”</p><p><strong>MORE:</strong> <a href=#>Taylor Swift recreates old outfit with birthday look that must be a Midnights teaser</a></p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmpqX2aCcLDOo5hmm5GpeqS7zJ6qZpucmq6vec6vnKtlkpawrLjArJ9mmZapsrN50q2pmqaXmnq3tcOepqxlmaPAtrjTnptmoJWneqetzaxm</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
