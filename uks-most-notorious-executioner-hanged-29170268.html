to be a hangman’s assistant and was soon promoted to the top job.</p><p>He would travel the country carrying out executions for a fee of no more than £15 a time – around £1,200 in today’s money.</p><p>Believing his job was “sacred” and a “higher power” and had selected him, Pierrepoint developed a reputation for making painstaking preparations before each individual hanging.</p><p>He’d carefully note the height and weight of the person condemned, recording comments about their build like “wiry” or “flabby”.</p><img

precise length of drop needed to swiftly and humanely break their neck, even practising with a sack.</p><p>Pierrepoint would go on to execute some of the worst villains of the era, and in 1941 he hanged London gangster Antonio “Babe” Mancini, who’d stabbed a man to death in a bar brawl.</p><p>Meanwhile “Blackout Ripper” Gordon Cummins, who had killed four women, was hanged in 1942.</p><p>Pierrepoint executed 15 German spies in the <a href=# rel=follow data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link data-content-type=section-topic>Second World War</a> as well as traitors, including broadcaster William Joyce, better known as Lord Haw-Haw.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

conflict he was drafted in by Allied commanders to hang 200 Nazi war criminals in Germany.</p><p>Among them were Josef Kramer, the “Beast of Belsen” who had been commandant at the notorious concentration camp and fellow war criminal Irma Grese, a vicious guard at Auschwitz.</p><p>Back in Britain, Pierrepoint would continue professionally to see away killers such as the acid bath murderer, John George Haigh – responsible for slaughtering six people – in 1949.</p><p>Four years later he hanged serial killer John Christie, who’d strangled eight people at his 10 Rillington Place home in Notting Hill, west London, with the hanging taking him “less time than it took the ash to fall off a cigar”.</p><img

was just seven seconds, but he never lacked compassion – after hanging Ruth Ellis, who was the last woman to be executed in Britain, for killing her lover, in 1955, he said she “died as brave as any man”.</p><p>Despite his gruesome work, the cigar-chomping Pierrepoint was a cheerful chap and while carrying out hangings even began to run a pub called the Help the Poor Struggler in Oldham, Lancashire.</p><p>Sadly, in 1950, he’d end up hanging one of its regulars, James Corbitt, who had murdered his girlfriend.</p><p>He suddenly gave up his role as hangman in 1956 after a row over his fees, retiring to run another pub in Preston with his wife Annie.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article29170248.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_Josef-Kramer.jpg><p>Pierrepoint, played by Timothy Spall in a 2005 film, is said to have boasted he had hanged more people than any other person in British history.</p><p>Yet some had later turned out to be innocent, such as Timothy Evans, who was wrongfully convicted in 1950 for murdering his wife and daughter – John Christie was found to be the real culprit.</p><p>Pierrepoint eventually came to the conclusion that the death penalty, abolished in 1969, didn’t work and wasn’t a deterrent, and before his death in 1992, aged 87, he said: “Capital punishment, in my view, achieved nothing except revenge.”</p><p><b>READ NOW:</b></p><ul><li><b><a href=# rel=follow
